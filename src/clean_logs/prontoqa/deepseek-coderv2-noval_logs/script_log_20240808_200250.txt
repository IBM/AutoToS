Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
To define successor states given a collection of rules, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify Applicable Rules**: For each rule `if X then Y`, check if `X` is present in the current state.
2. **Generate Successor States**: For each applicable rule, create a new state by adding `Y` to the current state.
3. **Ensure Uniqueness**: Ensure that each successor state is unique.

Let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Identify Applicable Rules**:
   - Iterate through the list of rules.
   - For each rule `(X, Y)`, check if `X` is in the current state.

2. **Generate Successor States**:
   - If `X` is in the current state, create a new state by copying the current state and adding `Y` to it.

3. **Ensure Uniqueness**:
   - Use a set or a similar mechanism to ensure that each successor state is unique.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

python
```
def successor(state, rules):
    successor_states = set()
    
    for rule in rules:
        X, Y = rule
        if X in state:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(Y)
            successor_states.add(frozenset(new_state))
    
    return [set(s) for s in successor_states]

# Example usage:
initial_state = {"integer"}
rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

successor_states = successor(initial_state, rules)
print(successor_states)
```

### Explanation:
- **`successor` Function**:
  - Takes `state` (a set representing the current knowledge) and `rules` (a list of tuples representing the rules).
  - Initializes an empty set `successor_states` to store unique successor states.
  - Iterates through each rule.
  - Checks if the antecedent `X` is in the current state.
  - If true, creates a new state by copying the current state and adding the consequent `Y`.
  - Converts the new state to a `frozenset` to ensure it is hashable and can be added to a set.
  - Converts each `frozenset` back to a `set` before returning the list of successor states.

This implementation ensures that each successor state is unique and correctly derived from the current state using the given rules
