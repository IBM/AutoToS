Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
Successor States Definition
Given a state (current knowledge) and a collection of rules, successor states are defined as follows:
For each rule "if X then Y" in the collection:
Check if X is in the current state (we know X).
If X is in the current state, create a new state by adding Y to the current state.
Collect all new states created in step 1 as the successor states.
Python Implementation
Here is the Python implementation for the successor function:
Python
```
def successor_states(state, rules):
    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        if rule[0] in state:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(rule[1])
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    return successor_states

# Example usage:
initial_state = {"integer"}
rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]
print(successor_states(initial_state, rules))
```
Output:
Python
[{'integer', 'real number'}, {'integer', 'float'}]
In this implementation, the successor_states function takes a state (a set of knowledge) and a list of rules (each rule is a tuple of "if X then Y"). It iterates over each rule, checks if the condition X is in the current state, and if so, creates a new state by adding Y to the current state. Finally, it returns a list of all successor states

Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 

Model response:
Python
```
def goal_test(state, target_fact):
    return target_fact in state

# Example usage:
state = {"integer", "real number", "float"}
target_fact = "real number"
print(goal_test(state, target_fact))  # Output: True
``
