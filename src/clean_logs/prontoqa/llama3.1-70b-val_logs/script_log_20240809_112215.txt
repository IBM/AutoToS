Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
Let's break down the process step by step:
We start with an initial state, which represents our current knowledge about the world.
We have a collection of rules, where each rule is of the form "if X then Y".
To find the successor states, we apply each rule to the current state.
A rule is applicable if the current state contains X.
If a rule is applicable, we add Y to the current state to create a new successor state.
We repeat steps 3-5 for all rules and all possible combinations of applicable rules.
Here is the Python implementation for the successor function:
Python
```
def get_successor_states(state, rules):
    successor_states = [state]
    for rule in rules:
        if rule[0] in state:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(rule[1])
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    return successor_states
```
Note that this implementation assumes that the state is represented as a set of strings, and the rules are represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two strings. The function returns a list of sets, where each set represents a successor state

Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state.
