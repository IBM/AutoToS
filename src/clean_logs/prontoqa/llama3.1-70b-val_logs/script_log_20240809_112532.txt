Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
Here is the Python implementation for the successor function:
Python
```
def successor_states(state, rules):
    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        if rule[0] in state:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(rule[1])
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    return successor_states

# Example usage:
initial_state = {"integer"}
rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]
print(successor_states(initial_state, rules))
```
This function iterates over each rule. If the premise of the rule (rule[0]) is in the current state, it creates a new state by copying the current state and adding the conclusion of the rule (rule[1]). This new state is then added to the list of successor states. Finally, the function returns the list of successor states

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 

Model response:
Here is the Python function for the goal test:
Python
```
def is_goal_state(state, target_fact):
    return target_fact in state
```
This function checks if the target fact is present in the state, returning True if it is and False otherwise
