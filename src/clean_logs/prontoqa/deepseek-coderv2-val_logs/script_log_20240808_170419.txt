Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
To define successor states given a collection of rules, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify Applicable Rules**: For each rule `if X then Y`, check if `X` is present in the current state.
2. **Generate Successor States**: For each applicable rule, create a new state by adding `Y` to the current state.
3. **Ensure Uniqueness**: Each successor state should be unique to avoid redundant states.

Let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Identify Applicable Rules**:
   - Iterate through the list of rules.
   - For each rule `(X, Y)`, check if `X` is in the current state.

2. **Generate Successor States**:
   - If `X` is in the current state, create a new state by copying the current state and adding `Y` to it.

3. **Ensure Uniqueness**:
   - Use a set or a similar data structure to ensure that each successor state is unique.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

python
```
def successor(state, rules):
    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        X, Y = rule
        if X in state:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(Y)
            if new_state not in successor_states:
                successor_states.append(new_state)
    return successor_states

# Example usage:
initial_state = {"integer"}
rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]
print(successor(initial_state, rules))
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Input**:
  - `state`: A set representing the current knowledge of the world.
  - `rules`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(X, Y)` represents a rule `if X then Y`.

- **Process**:
  - Iterate through each rule.
  - Check if `X` is in the current state.
  - If `X` is present, create a new state by copying the current state and adding `Y`.
  - Ensure the new state is unique by checking if it is not already in the list of successor states.

- **Output**:
  - A list of sets, each representing a unique successor state.

This implementation ensures that we generate all possible successor states based on the given rules and the current state, while avoiding duplicates

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 

Model response:
Certainly! Below is the Python function for the goal test function that checks whether a given state contains the target fact, indicating that the state is a goal state:

python
```
def is_goal_state(state, target_fact):
    return target_fact in state

# Example usage:
# state = {"integer", "real number"}
# target_fact = "real number"
# print(is_goal_state(state, target_fact))  # Output: True
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Input**:
  - `state`: A set representing the current knowledge of the world.
  - `target_fact`: A string representing the fact we are looking for in the state.

- **Process**:
  - The function checks if `target_fact` is an element of the `state` set.

- **Output**:
  - Returns `True` if `target_fact` is in the `state`, indicating that the state is a goal state.
  - Returns `False` otherwise.

This function is straightforward and efficient, leveraging the set data structure's membership test operation
