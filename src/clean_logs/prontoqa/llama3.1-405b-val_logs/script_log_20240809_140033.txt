Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
Successor States Definition
Given a state and a collection of rules, we can define successor states as follows:
Initialize an empty list to store the successor states.
For each rule in the collection of rules:
Check if the condition (X) of the rule is present in the current state.
If the condition is met, create a new state by adding the conclusion (Y) of the rule to the current state.
Add the new state to the list of successor states.
Return the list of successor states.
Python Implementation
Python
```
def successor_states(state, rules):
    """
    Generate successor states by applying a collection of rules to the current state.

    Args:
    state (set): The current state of knowledge.
    rules (list): A list of rules, where each rule is a tuple of (condition, conclusion).

    Returns:
    list: A list of successor states.
    """
    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        condition, conclusion = rule
        if condition in state:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(conclusion)
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    return successor_states

# Example usage
initial_state = {"integer"}
rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]
successors = successor_states(initial_state, rules)
for i, successor in enumerate(successors):
    print(f"Successor State {i+1}: {successor}")
```
In this implementation, we use a set to represent the state, allowing for efficient membership checks and addition of new elements. We iterate over each rule, check if the condition is met, and create a new state by adding the conclusion to the current state. Finally, we add the new state to the list of successor states.
Note that this implementation assumes that the rules are applicable in any order, and that the conclusions of the rules are distinct. If the rules have dependencies or if the conclusions can be the same, additional logic may be required to handle these cases correctly.
