Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
Successor States Generation
Definition
Given a state and a collection of rules, a successor state is generated by applying each applicable rule to the current state. A rule if X then Y is applicable if X is present in the current state. The successor state is then defined as the current state extended with Y for each applicable rule.
Step-by-Step Process
Start with the current state: Begin with the initial state of knowledge.
Iterate through each rule: For each rule in the collection of rules, check if the rule is applicable.
Check rule applicability: A rule if X then Y is applicable if X is in the current state.
Generate successor state: If a rule is applicable, generate a new state by adding Y to the current state.
Collect all successor states: Gather all the newly generated states from applicable rules.
Python Implementation
Python
```
def successor_states(state, rules):
    """

        if rule[0] in state:
            # Generate a new state by adding the consequence of the rule to the current state
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(rule[1])
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    return successor_states

# Example usage
initial_state = {"integer"}

This Python function takes in a state represented as a set and a list of rules where each rule is a tuple representing the condition and consequence. It iterates through each rule, checks for applicability, and generates a new state by adding the consequence of the applicable rule to the current state. Finally, it returns a list of all generated successor states.
