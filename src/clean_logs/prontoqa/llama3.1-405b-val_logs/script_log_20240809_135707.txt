Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
Successor States Definition
Given a state and a collection of rules, we can define successor states as follows:
Initialize an empty list to store the successor states.
Iterate over each rule in the collection of rules.
For each rule, check if the condition (X) is present in the current state.
If the condition is met, create a new state by adding the conclusion (Y) to the current state.
Add the new state to the list of successor states.
Return the list of successor states.
Python Implementation
Python
```
def successor_states(state, rules):
    """
    Generate successor states by applying a collection of rules to the current state.

    Args:
    state (set): The current state of knowledge.
    rules (list): A list of rules, where each rule is a tuple (X, Y) meaning "if X then Y".

    Returns:
    list: A list of successor states.
    """
    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        condition, conclusion = rule
        if condition in state:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(conclusion)
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    return successor_states

# Example usage:
initial_state = {"integer"}
rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]
print(successor_states(initial_state, rules))
```
In this example, the successor_states function takes an initial state and a list of rules as input. It applies each rule to the state, creating new states by adding the conclusion of each applicable rule. The function returns a list of these successor states.
When you run this code with the provided example initial state and rules, it will output:
Python
[{'integer', 'real number'}, {'integer', 'float'}]
