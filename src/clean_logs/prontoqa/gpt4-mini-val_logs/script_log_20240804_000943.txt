Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
```python
def successor(state, rules):
    def apply_rule(state, rule):
        condition, result = rule
        if condition in state:
            return state | {result}
        return None

    successors = set()
    for rule in rules:
        new_state = apply_rule(state, rule)
        if new_state is not None:
            successors.add(frozenset(new_state))

    return [dict(s) for s in successors]
```

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 

Model response:
```python
def goal_test(state, target_fact):
    return target_fact in state
```

dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 12; 2 is required. Please fix this exception in the successor function.

Successor Iteration 2

AutoToS prompt:
Invalid transition: length mismatch - the length of a successor must be one more than the parent.
Let's think step by step. First think through in words why the successor function produced a successor that had a length that was not exactly one more than the parent. Then provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that ensures the length of a successor is exactly one more than the parent.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Input state: {'painted lady', 'butterfly'}
Example wrong successor state: {'painted lady', 'butterfly'}
Rules: {('animal', 'multicellular'), ('lepidopteran', 'insect'), ('invertebrate', 'animal'), ('insect', 'arthropod'), ('arthropod', 'not-bony'), ('arthropod', 'protostome'), ('whale', 'bony'), ('insect', 'six-legged'), ('painted lady', 'butterfly'), ('butterfly', 'lepidopteran'), ('protostome', 'invertebrate')}

Model response:
The original `successor` function did not ensure that the resulting successor state had exactly one more fact than the parent state. This happened because it would return a new state that might contain facts already present in the current state, leading to no change in length. A valid successor must introduce exactly one new fact that is not already in the current state.

To fix this, we need to ensure that when we apply a rule, the resulting state must contain one more item than the current state. This means we should only consider rules that add a new fact that is not already present in the current state. 

Here is the revised `successor` function:

```python
def successor(state, rules):
    def apply_rule(state, rule):
        condition, result = rule
        if condition in state and result not in state:
            return state | {result}
        return None

    successors = set()
    for rule in rules:
        new_state = apply_rule(state, rule)
        if new_state is not None and len(new_state) == len(state) + 1:
            successors.add(frozenset(new_state))

    return [set(s) for s in successors]
```
