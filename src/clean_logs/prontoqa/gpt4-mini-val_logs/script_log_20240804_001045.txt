Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
```python
def successor(state, rules):
    def apply_rule(state, rule):
        premise, conclusion = rule
        if premise in state:
            return state | {conclusion}
        return state

    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        new_state = apply_rule(state, rule)
        if new_state != state and new_state not in successor_states:
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    
    return successor_states
```

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 

Model response:
```python
def goal_test(state, target_fact):
    return target_fact in state
```
