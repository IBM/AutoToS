AutoToS prompt:

Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
```python
def successor(state, rules):
    def apply_rules(state, rules):
        successors = set()
        for (condition, result) in rules:
            if condition in state:
                successors.add(result)
        return successors

    current_successors = apply_rules(state, rules)
    new_states = [{**state, **{succ}} for succ in current_successors]
    
    return new_states
```

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 

Model response:
```python
def goal_test(state, target_fact):
    return target_fact in state
```

The following exception was produced when testing the successor function: 
  File "<string>", line 10, in <listcomp>

'set' object is not a mapping. Please fix this exception in the successor function.
Model response:
```python
def successor(state, rules):
    def apply_rules(state, rules):
        successors = set()
        for (condition, result) in rules:
            if condition in state:
                successors.add(result)
        return successors

    current_successors = apply_rules(state, rules)
    new_states = [state | {succ} for succ in current_successors]
    
    return new_states
```
Successor Iteration 2

AutoToS prompt:
Invalid transition: length mismatch - the length of a successor must be one more than the parent.
Let's think step by step. First think through in words why the successor function produced a successor that had a length that was not exactly one more than the parent. Then provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that ensures the length of a successor is exactly one more than the parent.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Input state: {'painted lady', 'butterfly'}
Example wrong successor state: {'painted lady', 'butterfly'}
Rules: {('butterfly', 'lepidopteran'), ('arthropod', 'not-bony'), ('invertebrate', 'animal'), ('animal', 'multicellular'), ('protostome', 'invertebrate'), ('arthropod', 'protostome'), ('lepidopteran', 'insect'), ('insect', 'six-legged'), ('painted lady', 'butterfly'), ('insect', 'arthropod'), ('whale', 'bony')}

Model response:
The issue with the original `successor` function arises because it generated successor states by simply adding all possible results from the rules, irrespective of the fact that each successor state should be derived from the parent state by adding exactly one new fact. As a result, some generated successors might be duplicates of the original state, causing the length mismatch.

To ensure that each successor state has exactly one more element than the parent state, we will iterate through the applicable rules and create a new state for each applicable rule by adding exactly one new fact to the existing state.

Here's the revised implementation:

```python
def successor(state, rules):
    def apply_rules(state, rules):
        successors = []
        for (condition, result) in rules:
            if condition in state and result not in state:
                new_state = state | {result}
                successors.append(new_state)
        return successors

    return apply_rules(state, rules)
```
