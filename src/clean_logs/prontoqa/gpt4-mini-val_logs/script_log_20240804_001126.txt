AutoToS prompt:

Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
```python
def successor(state, rules):
    def applies(rule, state):
        return rule[0] in state

    successor_states = set()
    for rule in rules:
        if applies(rule, state):
            new_state = state.union({rule[1]})
            successor_states.add(frozenset(new_state))

    return [set(s) for s in successor_states]
```

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 

Model response:
```python
def goal_test(state, target_fact):
    return target_fact in state
```

AutoToS prompt:
Invalid transition: length mismatch - the length of a successor must be one more than the parent.
Let's think step by step. First think through in words why the successor function produced a successor that had a length that was not exactly one more than the parent. Then provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that ensures the length of a successor is exactly one more than the parent.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Input state: {'butterfly', 'painted lady'}
Example wrong successor state: {'butterfly', 'painted lady'}
Rules: {('invertebrate', 'animal'), ('arthropod', 'protostome'), ('protostome', 'invertebrate'), ('painted lady', 'butterfly'), ('insect', 'six-legged'), ('whale', 'bony'), ('animal', 'multicellular'), ('insect', 'arthropod'), ('lepidopteran', 'insect'), ('butterfly', 'lepidopteran'), ('arthropod', 'not-bony')}

Model response:
```python
def successor(state, rules):
    def applies(rule, state):
        return rule[0] in state

    successor_states = set()
    for rule in rules:
        if applies(rule, state):
            new_state = state.union({rule[1]})
            if len(new_state) == len(state) + 1:  # Ensure the successor length is one more
                successor_states.add(frozenset(new_state))

    return [set(s) for s in successor_states]
