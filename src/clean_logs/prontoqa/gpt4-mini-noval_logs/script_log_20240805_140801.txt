Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
```python
def successor(state, rules):
    def applicable_rules(current_state):
        return [(x, y) for (x, y) in rules if x in current_state]

    def apply_rule(current_state, rule):
        x, y = rule
        new_state = current_state | {y}
        return new_state

    new_states = set()
    applicable = applicable_rules(state)
    
    for rule in applicable:
        new_state = apply_rule(state, rule)
        new_states.add(frozenset(new_state))

    return [dict(state) for state in new_states]
```

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 

Model response:
```python
def goal_test(state, target_fact):
    return target_fact in state
```

System message:
