AutoToS prompt:

Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
```python
def successor(state, rules):
    def applicable_rules(state, rules):
        return [(x, y) for (x, y) in rules if x in state]

    successors = set()
    for (x, y) in applicable_rules(state, rules):
        new_state = state | {y}
        successors.add(frozenset(new_state))
    
    return [dict(succ) for succ in successors]

```

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 

Model response:
```python
def is_goal_state(state, target_fact):
    return target_fact in state
```
