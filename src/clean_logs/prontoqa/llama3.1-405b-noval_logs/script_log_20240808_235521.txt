Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
Successor States Definition
Given a state and a collection of rules, a successor state is defined as the state extended with the application of one rule. In other words, if we have a state S and a rule if X then Y, a successor state is obtained by adding Y to S if X is already in S.
Formally, given a state S and a rule if X then Y, a successor state S' is defined as:
S' = S ∪ {Y} if X ∈ S
In the context of the example provided:
Initial state: {"integer"}
Rules:
if "integer" then "real number"
if "integer" then "float"
Applying each rule to the initial state, we get two successor states:
Successor state 1: {"integer", "real number"}
Successor state 2: {"integer", "float"}

    """

    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        X, Y = rule
        if X in state:
            # Create a new state by adding Y to the current state
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(Y)
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    return successor_states

# Example usage
initial_state = {"integer"}
rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

successors = successor_states(initial_state, rules)
for i, successor in enumerate(successors):
    print(f"Successor state {i+1}: {successor}")
```
This Python function takes a state (represented as a set for efficient membership checks) and a list of rules (where each rule is a tuple), applies each applicable rule to the state, and returns a list of successor states. Each successor state is a new set that includes the original state's elements plus the consequence of applying a rule.
