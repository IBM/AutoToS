Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
Successor States Definition
Given a collection of rules, we define successor states as follows:
Start with the current state (our current knowledge of the world).
For each rule of the form "if X then Y", check if X is present in the current state.
If X is present, create a new state by adding Y to the current state.
The new state is a successor state.
Python Implementation
Python
```
def successor_states(state, rules):
    """
    Generate successor states by applying rules to the current state.

    Args:
    state (set): The current state (our current knowledge of the world).
    rules (list): A list of rules, where each rule is a tuple of (X, Y).

    Returns:
    list: A list of successor states.
    """
    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        X, Y = rule
        if X in state:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(Y)
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    return successor_states

# Example usage:
initial_state = {"integer"}
rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]
successors = successor_states(initial_state, rules)
for i, successor in enumerate(successors):
    print(f"Successor State {i+1}: {successor}")
```
This implementation uses sets to represent states, which automatically eliminates duplicates and provides efficient membership testing. The successor_states function iterates over each rule, checks if the rule is applicable, and creates a new state by adding the consequence of the rule to the current state. The new state is then added to the list of successor states.
