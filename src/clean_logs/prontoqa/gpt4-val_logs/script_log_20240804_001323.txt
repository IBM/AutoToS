Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
To define the successor states given a collection of rules, we need to follow these steps:

1. Iterate through each rule to check if the antecedent (X) of the rule exists in the current state.
2. If the antecedent exists, apply the rule by adding the consequent (Y) to the knowledge.
3. Generate a new state for each rule application that expands the current state with the consequent.
4. Return all unique new states generated by this application of rules.

Now, here is the Python implementation for the `successor` function:

```python
def successor(state, rules):
    from copy import deepcopy
    
    def apply_rule(state, rule):
        antecedent, consequent = rule
        if antecedent in state:
            new_state = deepcopy(state)
            new_state.add(consequent)
            return new_state
        return None
    
    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        new_state = apply_rule(state, rule)
        if new_state and new_state not in successor_states:
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    
    return successor_states
```

In this implementation, the `successor` function takes a `state` (a set of known facts) and a list of `rules` (each represented as a tuple). It then generates all possible successor states by applying each applicable rule to the current state and ensuring that all generated states are unique.

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 

Model response:
Here is the Python function for the goal test:

```python
def is_goal_state(state, goal):
    return goal in state
```

This function, `is_goal_state`, takes a `state` (a set of known facts) and a `goal` (a target fact) and simply checks if the goal fact is present in the state. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

AutoToS prompt:
Invalid transition: length mismatch - the length of a successor must be one more than the parent.
Let's think step by step. First think through in words why the successor function produced a successor that had a length that was not exactly one more than the parent. Then provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that ensures the length of a successor is exactly one more than the parent.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Input state: {'painted lady', 'butterfly'}
Example wrong successor state: {'painted lady', 'butterfly'}
Rules: {('lepidopteran', 'insect'), ('invertebrate', 'animal'), ('insect', 'arthropod'), ('painted lady', 'butterfly'), ('arthropod', 'protostome'), ('animal', 'multicellular'), ('protostome', 'invertebrate'), ('arthropod', 'not-bony'), ('butterfly', 'lepidopteran'), ('insect', 'six-legged'), ('whale', 'bony')}

Model response:
One possible reason the successor function might produce a successor state with the same length as the parent state is if the rule's consequent (Y) is already present in the current state. In such a case, adding it to the state does not increase its size.

To ensure that each successor state has exactly one more element than the parent state, we need to add a check to confirm that the consequent is not already in the state before generating the new state. Here is the revised code for the `successor` function:

```python
def successor(state, rules):
    from copy import deepcopy
    
    def apply_rule(state, rule):
        antecedent, consequent = rule
        if antecedent in state and consequent not in state:
            new_state = deepcopy(state)
            new_state.add(consequent)
            return new_state
        return None
    
    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        new_state = apply_rule(state, rule)
        if new_state and len(new_state) == len(state) + 1:
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    
    return successor_states
```

In this revised implementation, the `apply_rule` function checks first if the antecedent is in the state and if the consequent is not already in the state before creating a new state with the consequent added. This ensures that any new state generated has exactly one more element than the parent state.
