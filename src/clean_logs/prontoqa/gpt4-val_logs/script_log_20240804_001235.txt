Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
To define the successor states given a state and a collection of rules, we need to apply each rule to the current state to generate new states. A rule of the form (X, Y) can be applied if X is in the current state, resulting in a new state that includes Y in addition to everything already known in the current state.

Here's a step-by-step approach to creating the `successor` function:
1. Iterate over each rule.
2. Check if the rule's antecedent (X) is in the state.
3. If it is, create a new state that includes the consequent (Y) along with the current state.
4. Collect all such new states.
5. Return the list of these new states.

Now, let's implement the function in Python:

```python
def successor(state, rules):
    def apply_rule(state, rule):
        antecedent, consequent = rule
        if antecedent in state:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(consequent)
            return new_state
        return None
    
    successor_states = []
    
    for rule in rules:
        new_state = apply_rule(state, rule)
        if new_state is not None:
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    
    return successor_states

# Example usage:
# initial_state = {"integer"}
# rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]
# successor_states = successor(initial_state, rules)
# successor_states will be [{"integer", "real number"}, {"integer", "float"}]
```

In this implementation:
- `apply_rule` is an inner function that checks if a rule can be applied to the current state and returns the resulting new state if applicable.
- The `successor` function iterates over each rule, applies it using `apply_rule`, and collects all valid new states in `successor_states`.

This function will correctly generate all possible successor states based on the given rules and the initial state.

Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state.

AutoToS prompt:
Invalid transition: length mismatch - the length of a successor must be one more than the parent.
Let's think step by step. First think through in words why the successor function produced a successor that had a length that was not exactly one more than the parent. Then provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that ensures the length of a successor is exactly one more than the parent.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Input state: {'butterfly', 'painted lady'}
Example wrong successor state: {'butterfly', 'painted lady'}
Rules: {('whale', 'bony'), ('butterfly', 'lepidopteran'), ('insect', 'six-legged'), ('lepidopteran', 'insect'), ('painted lady', 'butterfly'), ('insect', 'arthropod'), ('protostome', 'invertebrate'), ('invertebrate', 'animal'), ('animal', 'multicellular'), ('arthropod', 'protostome'), ('arthropod', 'not-bony')}

Model response:
You are correct that the successor states must be such that each resultant state has exactly one more element than the parent state. Let's analyze and adjust our function accordingly:

1. Ensure that applying a rule indeed adds exactly one new fact to the state.
2. Verify that the state before applying the rule does not already include the rule's consequent.

Here is the revised implementation:

```python
def successor(state, rules):
    def apply_rule(state, rule):
        antecedent, consequent = rule
        if antecedent in state and consequent not in state:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(consequent)
            return new_state
        return None
    
    successor_states = []
    
    for rule in rules:
        new_state = apply_rule(state, rule)
        if new_state is not None and len(new_state) == len(state) + 1:
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    
    return successor_states
```

In this revised implementation:
- We ensure that `consequent` is not already in the state before applying the rule, ensuring that the new state is one element larger.
- We explicitly check the length of the new state to confirm it is exactly one more than the original state, before adding it to the successor states list. 

This should resolve the issue with invalid transitions.
