Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
Certainly! To generate successor states given a current state and a collection of rules, we can implement the function as follows:

1. Iterate through each rule.
2. Check if the condition (X) of the rule is in the current state.
3. If the condition is satisfied, apply the rule by adding the consequence (Y) to the state to form a new successor state.
4. Continue this for all rules and collect all unique successor states.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def generate_successor_states(state, rules):
    def apply_rule(current_state, rule):
        """Applies a rule to the current state if applicable."""
        X, Y = rule
        if X in current_state:
            # Create a new state with Y added to the current state
            new_state = current_state | {Y}
            return new_state
        return None

    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        new_state = apply_rule(state, rule)
        if new_state and new_state not in successor_states:
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    
    return successor_states
```

This function `generate_successor_states` will provide the list of possible successor states by applying each applicable rule to the current state.

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 

Model response:
Certainly! Here is the Python function for the goal test:

```python
def is_goal_state(state, target_fact):
    return target_fact in state
```

AutoToS prompt:
Invalid transition: length mismatch - the length of a successor must be one more than the parent.
Let's think step by step. First think through in words why the successor function produced a successor that had a length that was not exactly one more than the parent. Then provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that ensures the length of a successor is exactly one more than the parent.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Input state: {'painted lady', 'butterfly'}
Example wrong successor state: {'painted lady', 'butterfly'}
Rules: {('painted lady', 'butterfly'), ('arthropod', 'not-bony'), ('arthropod', 'protostome'), ('insect', 'arthropod'), ('insect', 'six-legged'), ('lepidopteran', 'insect'), ('whale', 'bony'), ('protostome', 'invertebrate'), ('animal', 'multicellular'), ('invertebrate', 'animal'), ('butterfly', 'lepidopteran')}

Model response:
Understood! The issue of generating successors that are not exactly one element longer than the parent state can arise if we do not correctly handle the addition of new elements to form successor states. We need to ensure that each generated successor state is one element larger than the current state.

Here's the updated function:

```python
def generate_successor_states(state, rules):
    def apply_rule(current_state, rule):
        """Applies a rule to the current state if applicable and generates a new state with exactly one more element."""
        X, Y = rule
        if X in current_state and Y not in current_state:
            # Create a new state with Y added to the current state
            new_state = current_state | {Y}
            if len(new_state) == len(current_state) + 1:
                return new_state
        return None

    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        new_state = apply_rule(state, rule)
        if new_state and new_state not in successor_states:
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    
    return successor_states
```

This function correctly generates successors by ensuring that the new state is formed by adding exactly one new element to the current state. If the length of the newly generated state is not exactly one more than the original state, it is discarded. This makes sure our successors are valid based on the given description.
