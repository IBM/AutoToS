Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the following steps:
1. Go through each rule and check if the condition (X) in the rule exists in our current state.
2. If the condition exists, it implies the result (Y) should be added to our state.
3. Generate a new state by adding Y and store it in the list of successor states.
4. Continue this for all rules.

Here's the Python function implementing this logic:

```python
def successor(state, rules):
    successors = []

    for x, y in rules:
        if x in state:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(y)
            if new_state not in successors:
                successors.append(new_state)

    return successors

# Example usage:
initial_state = {"integer"}
rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]
successor_states = successor(initial_state, rules)
```

In this function:
- We iterate through each rule.
- If the condition (x) of the rule is in the current state, we create a new state by copying the current state and adding the result (y).
- We ensure that we do not add duplicate states to the successor list.
- Finally, we return the list of all possible successor states.

    Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 
    
Model response:
```python
def is_goal_state(state, target_fact):
    return target_fact in state

# Example usage:
state = {"integer", "real number"}
target_fact = "real number"
goal_reached = is_goal_state(state, target_fact)
```
