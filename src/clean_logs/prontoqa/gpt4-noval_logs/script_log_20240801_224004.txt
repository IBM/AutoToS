Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
To determine the successor states of a given state based on a set of rules, we need to implement the following steps:

1. **Identify Applicable Rules**: For each rule, check if its antecedent (i.e., the "if X" part) is present in the current state.
2. **Generate New States**: Apply each applicable rule to generate new successor states by adding the consequent (i.e., the "then Y" part) of the rule to the current state if it is not already present.
3. **Collect and Return Successors**: Return a list of all unique successor states.

Now, let's implement the `successor` function that performs these steps:

```python
def successor(state, rules):
    def apply_rule(current_state, rule):
        antecedent, consequent = rule
        if antecedent in current_state and consequent not in current_state:
            new_state = current_state.copy()
            new_state.add(consequent)
            return new_state
        return None
    
    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        new_state = apply_rule(state, rule)
        if new_state is not None:
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    
    return successor_states

# Example usage:
# initial_state = {"integer"}
# rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]
# successors = successor(initial_state, rules)
# print(successors)
# Output should be: [{'integer', 'real number'}, {'integer', 'float'}]
```

In this function:
- `state` is a set representing the current knowledge of the world.
- `rules` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a rule in the form (X, Y).
- The `apply_rule` inner function checks if a rule can be applied and, if so, returns a new state with the rule's consequent added.
- We iterate through the rules, applying each applicable rule, and collect the resulting successor states.

AutoToS prompt:

    Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 
    
Model response:
Here is the Python function to test whether a given state is a goal state based on a target fact:

```python
def is_goal_state(state, target_fact):
    return target_fact in state

# Example usage:
# state = {"integer", "real number"}
# target_fact = "real number"
# result = is_goal_state(state, target_fact)
# result would be True in this case
```
