Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
To generate the successor states given the current state and a set of rules, we need to consider the following steps:

1. For each rule, check if the condition (X) is present in the current state.
2. If the condition is present, apply the rule to generate a new state where the conclusion (Y) is added to the current state.
3. Collect and return all unique successor states generated by applying all applicable rules.

Hereâ€™s the Python function that implements this logic:

```python
def generate_successor_states(state, rules):
    def apply_rule(state, rule):
        condition, conclusion = rule
        if condition in state:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(conclusion)
            return new_state
        return None
    
    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        new_state = apply_rule(state, rule)
        if new_state and new_state not in successor_states:
            successor_states.append(new_state)
            
    return successor_states

# Example usage:
# initial_state = {"integer"}
# rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float"), ("real number", "complex number")]
# successor_states = generate_successor_states(initial_state, rules)
```

AutoToS prompt:

    Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 
    
Model response:
```python
def is_goal_state(state, target_fact):
    return target_fact in state

# Example usage:
# state = {"integer", "real number"}
# target_fact = "real number"
# result = is_goal_state(state, target_fact)  # True
```
