Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
To implement the `successor` function, we need to apply each rule to the given state and generate new states based on these applications. Specifically, for each state, if the condition (X) of a rule is met (i.e., if X is already in the state), then we should create a new state that includes the conclusion (Y) of that rule.

Here's the complete Python implementation for the `successor` function:

```python
def successor(state, rules):
    """
    Generate successor states given a state and a collection of rules.

    :param state: A set representing the current knowledge of the world.
    :param rules: A list of tuples representing the rules of the form (X, Y).
    :return: A list of sets, each representing a successor state.
    """
    successor_states = []

    # Iterate over each rule and apply it if applicable
    for X, Y in rules:
        if X in state:
            # Create a new state including Y
            new_state = set(state)
            new_state.add(Y)
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    
    return successor_states

# Example usage:
# initial_state = {"integer"}
# rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]
# print(successor(initial_state, rules))
```

In this function:
- We start by initializing an empty list `successor_states`.
- We iterate over each rule in the provided collection of rules.
- For each rule, we check if its condition (X) is present in the current state.
- If the condition is met, we create a new state by adding the conclusion (Y) of the rule to the current state.
- We add each new state to the list of successor states.
- Finally, we return the list of new states that are generated by applying the rules to the current state.

    Provide only the Python function for the goal test function that tests, given a target fact, whether a state is a goal state. 
    
Model response:
Here's the Python function to test whether a given state is a goal state based on a target fact:

```python
def is_goal_state(state, target_fact):
    """
    Check if the given state is a goal state based on the target fact.

    :param state: A set representing the current knowledge of the world.
    :param target_fact: The fact that defines the goal state.
    :return: True if the state is a goal state, False otherwise.
    """
    return target_fact in state

# Example usage:
# state = {"integer", "real number"}
# target_fact = "real number"
# print(is_goal_state(state, target_fact))  # Output: True
```
