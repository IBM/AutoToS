Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
Successor States Definition
Given a state (our current knowledge) and a collection of rules, we can define successor states as follows:
For each rule if X then Y in the collection of rules:
Check if X is in the current state.
If X is in the current state, create a new state by adding Y to the current state.
Collect all new states created in step 1 as the successor states.
Python Implementation
Here is the Python implementation for the successor function:
Python
```
def successor_states(state, rules):
    successor_states = []
    for x, y in rules:
        if x in state:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(y)
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    return successor_states

# Example usage:
initial_state = {"integer"}
rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]
print(successor_states(initial_state, rules))
```
This will output:
Python
[{'integer', 'real number'}, {'integer', 'float'}]
In this implementation, we iterate over each rule. If the condition x of the rule is in the current state, we create a new state by copying the current state and adding the consequence y of the rule. We collect all these new states in the successor_states list, which we return at the end
