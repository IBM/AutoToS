Logical deduction is performed by applying rules of the form if X then Y to our current knowledge about a world, extending our knowledge with each single rule application. 
A rule if X then Y is applicable if we know X. If a state is defined as our current knowledge of the world, how are successor states defined, given a collection of rules? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python implementation for the successor function that receives a state and rules and returns a list of successor states.

Example initial state: {"integer"}
Example rules: [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]

Model response:
Successor States Definition
Given a state (our current knowledge) and a collection of rules, successor states are defined as follows:
For each rule in the collection, check if the condition (X) is present in the current state.
If the condition is met, create a new state by adding the consequence (Y) to the current state.
Collect all new states generated by applying the applicable rules.
Python Implementation
Python
```
def get_successor_states(state, rules):
    successor_states = []
    for rule in rules:
        if rule[0] in state:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state.add(rule[1])
            successor_states.append(new_state)
    return successor_states

# Example usage:
initial_state = {"integer"}
rules = [("integer", "real number"), ("integer", "float")]
successor_states = get_successor_states(initial_state, rules)
print(successor_states)
```
This Python function takes a state and a list of rules as input, applies the rules to generate successor states, and returns them as a list. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with the provided initial state and rules
