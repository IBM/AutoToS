I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do
   Pick up a block from the table
   Put down a block on the table
   Unstack a block from on top of another block
   Stack a block on top of another block

   I have the following restrictions on my actions:
   I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
   I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
   I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
   I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
   I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
   Once I pick up a block, I am holding the block and it is no longer clear and no longer on the table. 
   Once I unstack from on top of another block, I am holding the block and it is no longer clear. Instead, the other block becomes clear.   

   I can only put down a block that I am holding.
   I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
   I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
   Once I put down a block, my hand becomes empty, the block becomes clear, and it is now on the table.
   Once I stack a block on top of another block, the block on top becomes clear and the block under it is no longer clear.
If a state is defined by a dictionary of following predicates "clear block", "on-table block", "arm-empty", "holding block", and "on block1 block2", how are successor states defined? 
Here is an example of the initial state:
Init: {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}
Please provide only the Python code for the successor function that returns a list of successor states.

AutoToS prompt:

    Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. The goal specifies a partial state, the facts that must be true in any full goal state. Assume that the goal configuration is provided in the same dictionary format. 
    Here's an example goal specification:
    Goal: {'clear': [], 'on-table': [], 'on': [('b', 'c'), ('d', 'b')]}

AutoToS prompt:
Successor function when run on the state {'clear': ['a'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': False, 'holding': 'b', 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('c', 'd')]} failed to produce all successors.
Missing successors are: [{'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('c', 'd'), ('b', 'a')]}]
First think step by step why the successor function failed to produce all successors of the state.
Then, fix the successor function.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
The missing successor indicates a situation where the block 'b' should have been placed on top of 'a'. This suggests that there is a scenario not covered in the initial successor function, specifically, stacking a held block onto a clear block that is part of another stack.

Let's step through the original successor function and identify where it falls short:

1. Checking for the ability to pick up a block from the table: This part is correct.
2. Handling putting down a block on the table: This part is correct.
3. Unstacking a block: This part is correct.
4. Stacking a block onto another block: While this part is attempting to be correct, it seems it didn't account for ensuring all combinations, especially checking if the block to be stacked on is clear.

Let's revisit and fix the stacking part specifically.
