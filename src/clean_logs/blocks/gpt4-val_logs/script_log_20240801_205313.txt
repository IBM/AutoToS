I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do
   Pick up a block from the table
   Put down a block on the table
   Unstack a block from on top of another block
   Stack a block on top of another block

   I have the following restrictions on my actions:
   I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
   I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
   I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
   I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
   I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
   Once I pick up a block, I am holding the block and it is no longer clear and no longer on the table. 
   Once I unstack from on top of another block, I am holding the block and it is no longer clear. Instead, the other block becomes clear.   

   I can only put down a block that I am holding.
   I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
   I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
   Once I put down a block, my hand becomes empty, the block becomes clear, and it is now on the table.
   Once I stack a block on top of another block, the block on top becomes clear and the block under it is no longer clear.
If a state is defined by a dictionary of following predicates "clear block", "on-table block", "arm-empty", "holding block", and "on block1 block2", how are successor states defined? 
Here is an example of the initial state:
Init: {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}
Please provide only the Python code for the successor function that returns a list of successor states.

Model response:
Sure, here's the Python code for the successor function that returns a list of successor states based on the rules and initial conditions provided:

```python
def get_successor_states(state):
    import copy

    def pick_up(block):
        if state['arm-empty'] and block in state['clear'] and block in state['on-table']:
            new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
            new_state['arm-empty'] = False
            new_state['holding'] = block
            new_state['clear'].remove(block)
            new_state['on-table'].remove(block)
            return new_state
        return None

    def put_down(block):
        if state['holding'] == block:
            new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
            new_state['arm-empty'] = True
            new_state['holding'] = None
            new_state['clear'].append(block)
            new_state['on-table'].append(block)
            return new_state
        return None

    def unstack(block1, block2):
        if state['arm-empty'] and (block1, block2) in state['on'] and block1 in state['clear']:
            new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
            new_state['arm-empty'] = False
            new_state['holding'] = block1
            new_state['clear'].remove(block1)
            new_state['clear'].append(block2)
            new_state['on'].remove((block1, block2))
            return new_state
        return None

    def stack(block1, block2):
        if state['holding'] == block1 and block2 in state['clear']:
            new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
            new_state['arm-empty'] = True
            new_state['holding'] = None
            new_state['clear'].append(block1)
            new_state['clear'].remove(block2)
            new_state['on'].append((block1, block2))
            return new_state
        return None

    blocks = set(state['clear'] + state['on-table'])
    for block, _ in state['on']:
        blocks.add(block)
    successors = []

    # Generate all possible states by picking up all clear blocks from the table
    for block in state['clear']:
        if block in state['on-table']:
            new_state = pick_up(block)
            if new_state:
                successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Generate all possible states by putting down the currently held block
    if state['holding']:
        new_state = put_down(state['holding'])
        if new_state:
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Generate all possible states by unstacking any block that is on top of another
    for block1, block2 in state['on']:
        new_state = unstack(block1, block2)
        if new_state:
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Generate all possible states by stacking the currently held block onto any clear block
    if state['holding']:
        for block in state['clear']:
            new_state = stack(state['holding'], block)
            if new_state:
                successors.append(new_state)

    return successors

# Test the function with the given initial state example
initial_state = {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}
print(get_successor_states(initial_state))
```

This code defines the possible successor states by checking all legal actions (pick up, put down, unstack, stack) based on the provided rules and initial conditions. Each action creates a new state which is appended to the list of successors, and the function returns this list.

# Test the function with the given initial state example
initial_state = {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}
print(get_successor_states(initial_state))

    Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. The goal specifies a partial state, the facts that must be true in any full goal state. Assume that the goal configuration is provided in the same dictionary format. 
    Here's an example goal specification:
    Goal: {'clear': [], 'on-table': [], 'on': [('b', 'c'), ('d', 'b')]}
    
Model response:
Certainly! Here's the Python function that tests whether a state is a goal state given a goal configuration:

```python
def is_goal_state(state, goal):
    def check_clear():
        return all(block in state['clear'] for block in goal.get('clear', []))
    
    def check_on_table():
        return all(block in state['on-table'] for block in goal.get('on-table', []))
    
    def check_on():
        return all(pair in state['on'] for pair in goal.get('on', []))
        
    return check_clear() and check_on_table() and check_on()

# Test the function with the given initial state example and goal specification
initial_state = {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}
goal_state = {'clear': [], 'on-table': [], 'on': [('b', 'c'), ('d', 'b')]}
print(is_goal_state(initial_state, goal_state))
```

This function checks if the current state has all the predicates specified in the goal state. It ensures that any block specified as clear in the goal is indeed clear, any block specified as on the table in the goal is indeed on the table, and any "on" relationship specified in the goal exists in the current state.
