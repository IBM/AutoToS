I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do
   Pick up a block from the table
   Put down a block on the table
   Unstack a block from on top of another block
   Stack a block on top of another block

   I have the following restrictions on my actions:
   I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
   I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
   I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
   I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
   I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
   Once I pick up a block, I am holding the block and it is no longer clear and no longer on the table. 
   Once I unstack from on top of another block, I am holding the block and it is no longer clear. Instead, the other block becomes clear.   

   I can only put down a block that I am holding.
   I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
   I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
   Once I put down a block, my hand becomes empty, the block becomes clear, and it is now on the table.
   Once I stack a block on top of another block, the block on top becomes clear and the block under it is no longer clear.
If a state is defined by a dictionary of following predicates "clear block", "on-table block", "arm-empty", "holding block", and "on block1 block2", how are successor states defined? 
Here is an example of the initial state:
Init: {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}
Please provide only the Python code for the successor function that returns a list of successor states.

    Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. The goal specifies a partial state, the facts that must be true in any full goal state. Assume that the goal configuration is provided in the same dictionary format. 
    Here's an example goal specification:
    Goal: {'clear': [], 'on-table': [], 'on': [('b', 'c'), ('d', 'b')]}
