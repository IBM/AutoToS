AutoToS prompt:

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do
   Pick up a block from the table
   Put down a block on the table
   Unstack a block from on top of another block
   Stack a block on top of another block

   I have the following restrictions on my actions:
   I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
   I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
   I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
   I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
   I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
   Once I pick up a block, I am holding the block and it is no longer clear and no longer on the table. 
   Once I unstack from on top of another block, I am holding the block and it is no longer clear. Instead, the other block becomes clear.   

   I can only put down a block that I am holding.
   I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
   I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
   Once I put down a block, my hand becomes empty, the block becomes clear, and it is now on the table.
   Once I stack a block on top of another block, the block on top becomes clear and the block under it is no longer clear.
If a state is defined by a dictionary of following predicates "clear block", "on-table block", "arm-empty", "holding block", and "on block1 block2", how are successor states defined? 
Here is an example of the initial state:
Init: {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}
Please provide only the Python code for the successor function that returns a list of successor states.

Model response:
Here is the Python code for the successor function that returns a list of successor states based on the given actions and restrictions:

python
```
def successor(state):
    successors = []
    if state['arm-empty']:
        # Pick up a block from the table
        for block in state['clear']:
            if block in state['on-table']:
                new_state = state.copy()
                new_state['clear'] = [b for b in new_state['clear'] if b != block]
                new_state['on-table'] = [b for b in new_state['on-table'] if b != block]
                new_state['holding'] = block
                new_state['arm-empty'] = False
                successors.append(new_state)
        
        # Unstack a block from on top of another block
        for block1, block2 in state['on']:
            if block1 in state['clear']:
                new_state = state.copy()
                new_state['clear'] = [b for b in new_state['clear'] if b != block1] + [block2]
                new_state['on'] = [pair for pair in new_state['on'] if pair != (block1, block2)]
                new_state['holding'] = block1
                new_state['arm-empty'] = False
                successors.append(new_state)
    else:
        held_block = state['holding']
        # Put down a block on the table
        new_state = state.copy()
        new_state['clear'] = new_state['clear'] + [held_block]
        new_state['on-table'] = new_state['on-table'] + [held_block]
        new_state['holding'] = None
        new_state['arm-empty'] = True
        successors.append(new_state)
        
        # Stack a block on top of another block
        for block in state['clear']:
            if block != held_block:
                new_state = state.copy()
                new_state['clear'] = [b for b in new_state['clear'] if b != block] + [held_block]
                new_state['on'] = new_state['on'] + [(held_block, block)]
                new_state['holding'] = None
                new_state['arm-empty'] = True
                successors.append(new_state)
    
    return successors

# Example usage:
init_state = {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}
successor_states = successor(init_state)
for s in successor_states:
    print(s)
```

This function takes the current state as input and returns a list of possible successor states based on the allowed actions and restrictions. Each successor state is a modified copy of the current state reflecting the outcome of a single action

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. The goal specifies a partial state, the facts that must be true in any full goal state. Assume that the goal configuration is provided in the same dictionary format. 
Here's an example goal specification:
Goal: {'clear': [], 'on-table': [], 'on': [('b', 'c'), ('d', 'b')]}

Model response:
Here is the Python code that tests whether a state is a goal state based on the provided goal specification:

python
```
def is_goal_state(state, goal):
    for key in goal:
        if key == 'clear':
            if not all(block in state['clear'] for block in goal['clear']):
                return False
        elif key == 'on-table':
            if not all(block in state['on-table'] for block in goal['on-table']):
                return False
        elif key == 'on':
            if not all(pair in state['on'] for pair in goal['on']):
                return False
        elif key == 'arm-empty':
            if goal['arm-empty'] != state['arm-empty']:
                return False
        elif key == 'holding':
            if goal['holding'] != state['holding']:
                return False
    return True

# Example usage:
goal_state = {'clear': [], 'on-table': [], 'on': [('b', 'c'), ('d', 'b')]}
current_state = {'clear': ['a', 'd'], 'on-table': ['a', 'c'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('b', 'c'), ('d', 'b')]}
print(is_goal_state(current_state, goal_state))  # Output: True or False depending on the current state
```

This function checks if the current state meets all the conditions specified in the goal configuration. If all conditions are met, it returns `True`, indicating that the state is a goal state. Otherwise, it returns `False`
