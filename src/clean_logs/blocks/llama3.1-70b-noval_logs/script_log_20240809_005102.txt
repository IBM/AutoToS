I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do
   Pick up a block from the table
   Put down a block on the table
   Unstack a block from on top of another block
   Stack a block on top of another block

   I have the following restrictions on my actions:
   I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
   I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
   I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
   I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
   I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
   Once I pick up a block, I am holding the block and it is no longer clear and no longer on the table. 
   Once I unstack from on top of another block, I am holding the block and it is no longer clear. Instead, the other block becomes clear.   

   I can only put down a block that I am holding.
   I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
   I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
   Once I put down a block, my hand becomes empty, the block becomes clear, and it is now on the table.
   Once I stack a block on top of another block, the block on top becomes clear and the block under it is no longer clear.
If a state is defined by a dictionary of following predicates "clear block", "on-table block", "arm-empty", "holding block", and "on block1 block2", how are successor states defined? 
Here is an example of the initial state:
Init: {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}
Please provide only the Python code for the successor function that returns a list of successor states.

Model response:
Here is the Python code for the successor function:
Python
```
def successor(state):
    successors = []
    
    # Pick up a block from the table
    for block in state['on-table']:
        if block in state['clear']:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state['on-table'].remove(block)
            new_state['holding'] = block
            new_state['arm-empty'] = False
            new_state['clear'].remove(block)
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Put down a block on the table
    if not state['arm-empty']:
        new_state = state.copy()
        new_state['on-table'].append(state['holding'])
        new_state['holding'] = None
        new_state['arm-empty'] = True
        new_state['clear'].append(state['holding'])
        successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Unstack a block from on top of another block
    for block1, block2 in state['on']:
        if block1 in state['clear']:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state['on'].remove((block1, block2))
            new_state['holding'] = block1
            new_state['arm-empty'] = False
            new_state['clear'].remove(block1)
            new_state['clear'].append(block2)
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Stack a block on top of another block
    if not state['arm-empty']:
        for block in state['clear']:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state['on'].append((state['holding'], block))
            new_state['holding'] = None
            new_state['arm-empty'] = True
            new_state['clear'].remove(block)
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    return successors
```
This function generates all possible successor states by applying each action to the current state, while respecting the given restrictions. Note that this implementation assumes that the input state is valid and well-formed

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. The goal specifies a partial state, the facts that must be true in any full goal state. Assume that the goal configuration is provided in the same dictionary format. 
Here's an example goal specification:
Goal: {'clear': [], 'on-table': [], 'on': [('b', 'c'), ('d', 'b')]}

Model response:
Here is the Python code that tests whether a state is a goal state:
Python
```
def is_goal_state(state, goal):
    for key, value in goal.items():
        if key == 'on':
            # Check if all 'on' relations in goal are present in state
            if not all(relation in state['on'] for relation in value):
                return False
        else:
            # Check if all elements in goal[key] are present in state[key]
            if not set(value).issubset(state[key]):
                return False
    return True
```
This function checks if all the facts specified in the goal state are true in the given state. It handles the 'on' relation separately since it's a list of tuples, whereas the other keys have lists of blocks. If all the goal conditions are met, it returns True, indicating that the state is a goal state

AutoToS prompt:
Input state should not change as a result of applying the successor function.
State before successor function applied: {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}
State after successor function applied: {'clear': ['a'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('c', 'd')]}
Let's think step by step. First, think of the possible reasons why the input state may change as a result of applying the successor function, such as the use of shallow copy.
Then, provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that returns a list of successor states and ensure it does not change the input state.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
The issue is that the new_state variable is created using the copy() method, which creates a shallow copy of the original state. This means that the nested lists ('on-table', 'on', etc.) are not copied, but rather referenced. When we modify these lists in the new_state, we're actually modifying the original state.
To fix this, we need to create a deep copy of the original state. We can use the copy module's deepcopy() function to achieve this.
Here's the revised successor function:
Python
```
import copy

def successor(state):
    successors = []
    
    # Pick up a block from the table
    for block in state['on-table']:
        if block in state['clear']:
            new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
            new_state['on-table'].remove(block)
            new_state['holding'] = block
            new_state['arm-empty'] = False
            new_state['clear'].remove(block)
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Put down a block on the table
    if not state['arm-empty']:
        new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
        new_state['on-table'].append(state['holding'])
        new_state['holding'] = None
        new_state['arm-empty'] = True
        new_state['clear'].append(state['holding'])
        successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Unstack a block from on top of another block
    for block1, block2 in state['on']:
        if block1 in state['clear']:
            new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
            new_state['on'].remove((block1, block2))
            new_state['holding'] = block1
            new_state['arm-empty'] = False
            new_state['clear'].remove(block1)
            new_state['clear'].append(block2)
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Stack a block on top of another block
    if not state['arm-empty']:
        for block in state['clear']:
            new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
            new_state['on'].append((state['holding'], block))
            new_state['holding'] = None
            new_state['arm-empty'] = True
            new_state['clear'].remove(block)
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    return successors
```
By using deepcopy() instead of copy(), we ensure that each new_state is a completely independent copy of the original state, and modifying it won't affect the original state

AutoToS prompt:
Successor function when run on the state {'clear': ['a'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': False, 'holding': 'b', 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('c', 'd')]} failed to produce all successors.
Missing successors are: [{'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('c', 'd'), ('b', 'a')]}]
First think step by step why the successor function failed to produce all successors of the state.
Then, fix the successor function.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
The issue is that the successor function is not correctly handling the case where the arm is holding a block and we want to stack it on top of another block.
In the current implementation, the function only checks if the arm is empty before stacking a block on top of another block. However, we also need to check if the arm is holding a block and the block being held can be stacked on top of another block.
Here's the revised successor function:
Python
```
import copy

def successor(state):
    successors = []
    
    # Pick up a block from the table
    for block in state['on-table']:
        if block in state['clear']:
            new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
            new_state['on-table'].remove(block)
            new_state['holding'] = block
            new_state['arm-empty'] = False
            new_state['clear'].remove(block)
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Put down a block on the table
    if not state['arm-empty']:
        new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
        new_state['on-table'].append(state['holding'])
        new_state['holding'] = None
        new_state['arm-empty'] = True
        new_state['clear'].append(state['holding'])
        successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Unstack a block from on top of another block
    for block1, block2 in state['on']:
        if block1 in state['clear']:
            new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
            new_state['on'].remove((block1, block2))
            new_state['holding'] = block1
            new_state['arm-empty'] = False
            new_state['clear'].remove(block1)
            new_state['clear'].append(block2)
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Stack a block on top of another block
    if not state['arm-empty']:
        for block in state['clear']:
            new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
            new_state['on'].append((state['holding'], block))
            new_state['holding'] = None
            new_state['arm-empty'] = True
            new_state['clear'].remove(block)
            new_state['clear'].append(state['holding'])
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Add a new case to handle stacking the held block on top of another block
    if not state['arm-empty']:
        for block in state['clear']:
            new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
            new_state['on'].append((state['holding'], block))
            new_state['clear'].remove(block)
            new_state['clear'].append(state['holding'])
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    return successors
```
I added a new case to handle stacking the held block on top of another block. This case checks if the arm is holding a block and the block being held can be stacked on top of another block. If so, it creates a new successor state where the held block is stacked on top of the other block
