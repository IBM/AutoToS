I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do
   Pick up a block from the table
   Put down a block on the table
   Unstack a block from on top of another block
   Stack a block on top of another block

   I have the following restrictions on my actions:
   I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
   I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
   I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
   I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
   I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
   Once I pick up a block, I am holding the block and it is no longer clear and no longer on the table. 
   Once I unstack from on top of another block, I am holding the block and it is no longer clear. Instead, the other block becomes clear.   

   I can only put down a block that I am holding.
   I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
   I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
   Once I put down a block, my hand becomes empty, the block becomes clear, and it is now on the table.
   Once I stack a block on top of another block, the block on top becomes clear and the block under it is no longer clear.
If a state is defined by a dictionary of following predicates "clear block", "on-table block", "arm-empty", "holding block", and "on block1 block2", how are successor states defined? 
Here is an example of the initial state:
Init: {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}
Please provide only the Python code for the successor function that returns a list of successor states.

Model response:
Here is the Python code for the successor function:
Python
```
def successor(state):
    successors = []
    
    # Pick up a block from the table
    for block in state['on-table']:
        if block in state['clear']:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state['on-table'].remove(block)
            new_state['clear'].remove(block)
            new_state['holding'] = block
            new_state['arm-empty'] = False
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Put down a block on the table
    if not state['arm-empty']:
        new_state = state.copy()
        new_state['on-table'].append(state['holding'])
        new_state['clear'].append(state['holding'])
        new_state['holding'] = None
        new_state['arm-empty'] = True
        successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Unstack a block from on top of another block
    for block1, block2 in state['on']:
        if block1 in state['clear']:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state['on'].remove((block1, block2))
            new_state['clear'].remove(block1)

    if not state['arm-empty']:
        for block in state['clear']:
            new_state = state.copy()

This function generates all possible successor states by applying each action to the current state, while respecting the given restrictions. Note that this implementation assumes that the input state is valid and does not contain any contradictions

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. The goal specifies a partial state, the facts that must be true in any full goal state. Assume that the goal configuration is provided in the same dictionary format. 
Here's an example goal specification:
Goal: {'clear': [], 'on-table': [], 'on': [('b', 'c'), ('d', 'b')]}

Model response:
Here is the Python code that tests whether a state is a goal state:
Python
```

This function checks if the given state satisfies all the conditions specified in the goal. It returns True if the state is a goal state, and False otherwise. Note that this implementation assumes that the input state and goal are valid and do not contain any contradictions
Goal Iteration 1 - Goal Soundness Test

AutoToS prompt:
The goal test function failed on the following input state {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}, incorrectly reporting it as a non-goal state.
First think step by step what it means for a state to be a goal state in this domain. Then think through in words why the goal test function incorrectly reported input state: {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]} as a non-goal state. Now, revise the goal test function and ensure it returns true for the input state.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.
Goal: {'clear': [], 'on-table': [], 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}

Model response:
A state is a goal state if it satisfies all the conditions specified in the goal. In this domain, the goal specifies a partial state, and a state is a goal state if it matches the goal in all the specified aspects.
The goal test function incorrectly reported the input state as a non-goal state because it was checking for exact matches between the state and the goal, rather than checking if the state satisfies the conditions specified in the goal. Specifically, it was checking if the 'clear' and 'on-table' lists in the state were empty, rather than checking if all the blocks mentioned in the 'on' list in the goal were actually on top of each other in the state.
Here is the revised goal test function:
Python
```
def is_goal_state(state, goal):
    for key, value in goal.items():
        if key == 'on':
            for block1, block2 in value:
                if (block1, block2) not in state['on']:
                    return False
        elif key == 'clear':
            for block in value:
                if block not in state['clear']:
                    return False
        elif key == 'on-table':
            for block in value:
                if block not in state['on-table']:
                    return False
        elif key == 'arm-empty':
            if state['arm-empty'] != goal['arm-empty']:
                return False
        elif key == 'holding':
            if state['holding'] != goal['holding']:
                return False
    return True
```
This revised function only checks if the state satisfies the conditions specified in the goal, rather than checking for exact matches. It returns True for the input state {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]} and the goal {'clear': [], 'on-table': [], 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}, as expected

Successor Iteration 1

AutoToS prompt:
Input state should not change as a result of applying the successor function.
State before successor function applied: {'clear': ['b'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('c', 'd')]}
State after successor function applied: {'clear': ['a'], 'on-table': ['d'], 'arm-empty': True, 'holding': None, 'on': [('a', 'c'), ('c', 'd')]}
Let's think step by step. First, think of the possible reasons why the input state may change as a result of applying the successor function, such as the use of shallow copy.
Then, provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that returns a list of successor states and ensure it does not change the input state.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
The input state may change as a result of applying the successor function because the successor function is modifying the original state dictionary. This is likely due to the use of shallow copies, where the function is creating new lists but still referencing the same original dictionary.
Here is the revised successor function that returns a list of successor states without modifying the input state:
Python
```
def successor(state):
    successors = []
    
    # Create a deep copy of the state to avoid modifying the original state
    state_copy = {
        'clear': state['clear'].copy(),
        'on-table': state['on-table'].copy(),
        'arm-empty': state['arm-empty'],
        'holding': state['holding'],
        'on': state['on'].copy()
    }
    
    # Pick up a block from the table
    for block in state_copy['on-table']:
        if block in state_copy['clear']:
            new_state = state_copy.copy()
            new_state['on-table'].remove(block)
            new_state['clear'].remove(block)
            new_state['holding'] = block
            new_state['arm-empty'] = False
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Put down a block on the table
    if not state_copy['arm-empty']:
        new_state = state_copy.copy()
        new_state['on-table'].append(state_copy['holding'])
        new_state['clear'].append(state_copy['holding'])
        new_state['holding'] = None
        new_state['arm-empty'] = True
        successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Unstack a block from on top of another block
    for block1, block2 in state_copy['on']:
        if block1 in state_copy['clear']:
            new_state = state_copy.copy()
            new_state['on'].remove((block1, block2))
            new_state['clear'].remove(block1)
            new_state['clear'].append(block2)
            new_state['holding'] = block1
            new_state['arm-empty'] = False
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    # Stack a block on top of another block
    if not state_copy['arm-empty']:
        for block in state_copy['clear']:
            new_state = state_copy.copy()
            new_state['on'].append((state_copy['holding'], block))
            new_state['clear'].remove(block)
            new_state['clear'].append(state_copy['holding'])
            new_state['holding'] = None
            new_state['arm-empty'] = True
            successors.append(new_state)
    
    return successors
```
This revised function creates a deep copy of the input state at the beginning, and then modifies the copy to generate successor states. This ensures that the input state remains unchanged
