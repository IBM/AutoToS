This domain models the classic Sokoban game, where the robot needs to move around and push stones to specific locations while adhering to the constraints defined by the walls in the maze. 
The maze is defined by a grid of values 0,1, and 2, where 2 means it is a goal location for a stone, 1 means the cell is blocked, and either 0 or 2 means that the cell can be occupied. A cell is clear if it can be occupied, but is not occupied by either the player or any stone.

The actions are:

move: This action moves the player in a specified direction. To perform this action, the target location must be clear and adjacent to player's location. Performing this action will result in the player being at the target location and no longer at the starting location, meaning the starting location is now clear, while the target location is now not clear.

push: This action allows the player to push a stone in a specified direction. To perform this action, the player's location, the stone location, and the target location must line up in the same direction, and the target location must be clear. Performing the action results in player being at the stone's initial location and the stone is at the target location. Further, the player's previous location is clear, while the target location is not clear.

Assume that states are defined by a dictionary with keys at-player and at-stone. 
Here is an example of a state
{'at-player': (4, 4), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
Here is an example of the grid:
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state for a given goal configuration. Assume that the goal configuration is provided by the 2-dimensional array as before. The function should receive a state and the 2-dimensional array and return True if the state is a goal state and False otherwise.

Invalid transition: a stone and the player are at the same location.
Let's think step by step. First think through in words why the successor function produced a successor that has a stone and the player at the same location. Then provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that ensures that in all successors the player and the stones are at different locations.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Input state: {'at-player': (4, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
Example wrong successor state: {'at-player': (3, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}

Model response:
### Analysis in Words

The successor function produced a successor where the player and a stone are at the same location because the `push_stone` function does not properly update the stone's location in the list of stones when the player pushes it. Specifically, the function does not ensure that the player's new location is not the same as the stone's new location after the push. This can happen if the player pushes a stone into a position where another stone already exists.

To fix this, we need to ensure that after a push action, the player's new location is not the same as any of the stones' locations. Additionally, we should ensure that the stone being pushed is correctly updated in the list of stones without duplicating its entry.

### Revised Successor Function

python
```
def get_successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(location):
        x, y = location
        return grid[x][y] == 0 or grid[x][y] == 2

    def is_valid_move(location):
        x, y = location
        return 0 <= x < len(grid) and 0 <= y < len(grid[0]) and is_clear(location)

    def move_player(direction):
        x, y = state['at-player']
        if direction == 'up':
            new_location = (x - 1, y)
        elif direction == 'down':
            new_location = (x + 1, y)
        elif direction == 'left':
            new_location = (x, y - 1)
        elif direction == 'right':
            new_location = (x, y + 1)
        else:
            return None

        if is_valid_move(new_location) and new_location not in state['at-stone']:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state['at-player'] = new_location
            return new_state
        return None

    def push_stone(direction):
        x, y = state['at-player']
        if direction == 'up':
            stone_location = (x - 1, y)
            new_stone_location = (x - 2, y)
        elif direction == 'down':
            stone_location = (x + 1, y)
            new_stone_location = (x + 2, y)
        elif direction == 'left':
            stone_location = (x, y - 1)
            new_stone_location = (x, y - 2)
        elif direction == 'right':
            stone_location = (x, y + 1)
            new_stone_location = (x, y + 2)
        else:
            return None

        if stone_location in state['at-stone'] and is_valid_move(new_stone_location) and new_stone_location not in state['at-stone']:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state['at-player'] = stone_location
            new_state['at-stone'] = [new_stone_location if s == stone_location else s for s in new_state['at-stone']]
            return new_state
        return None

    directions = ['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']
    successor_states = []

    for direction in directions:
        move_result = move_player(direction)
        if move_result:
            successor_states.append(move_result)

        push_result = push_stone(direction)
        if push_result:
            successor_states.append(push_result)

    return successor_states
```

This revised function ensures that the player and stones are never at the same location in any successor state by checking the new player and stone locations after each action
