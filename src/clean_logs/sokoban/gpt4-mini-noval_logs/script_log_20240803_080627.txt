AutoToS prompt:

This domain models the classic Sokoban game, where the robot needs to move around and push stones to specific locations while adhering to the constraints defined by the walls in the maze. 
The maze is defined by a grid of values 0,1, and 2, where 2 means it is a goal location for a stone, 1 means the cell is blocked, and either 0 or 2 means that the cell can be occupied. A cell is clear if it can be occupied, but is not occupied by either the player or any stone.

The actions are:

move: This action moves the player in a specified direction. To perform this action, the target location must be clear and adjacent to player's location. Performing this action will result in the player being at the target location and no longer at the starting location, meaning the starting location is now clear, while the target location is now not clear.

push: This action allows the player to push a stone in a specified direction. To perform this action, the player's location, the stone location, and the target location must line up in the same direction, and the target location must be clear. Performing the action results in player being at the stone's initial location and the stone is at the target location. Further, the player's previous location is clear, while the target location is not clear.

Assume that states are defined by a dictionary with keys at-player and at-stone. 
Here is an example of a state
{'at-player': (4, 4), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
Here is an example of the grid:
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

Provide a Python implementation of successor states function, receiving a state and a grid and returning a list of immediate successor states.

Model response:
```python

        x, y = position
        return grid[x][y] == 0 or grid[x][y] == 2

        return {

            'at-stone': stones
        }

    player_pos = state['at-player']
    stone_positions = state['at-stone']
    successors = []

    directions = {
        'up': (-1, 0),
        'down': (1, 0),

    }

    for direction, (dx, dy) in directions.items():
        new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + dx, player_pos[1] + dy)

        if is_clear(new_player_pos):  # Move
            successors.append(move_player(new_player_pos))

        for stone_pos in stone_positions:
            if stone_pos == (player_pos[0] + dx * 2, player_pos[1] + dy * 2) and is_clear((stone_pos[0] + dx, stone_pos[1] + dy)):  # Push
                successors.append(push_stone(player_pos, stone_pos, new_player_pos))

    return successors
```

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state for a given goal configuration. Assume that the goal configuration is provided by the 2-dimensional array as before. The function should receive a state and the 2-dimensional array and return True if the state is a goal state and False otherwise.

Model response:
```python
def is_goal_state(state, goal_grid):
    def is_stone_at_goal(stone_position):
        x, y = stone_position
        return goal_grid[x][y] == 2

    return all(is_stone_at_goal(stone) for stone in state['at-stone'])

Error occurred for grid configuration: [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]]
Successor function when run on the state {'at-player': (5, 3), 'at-stone': [(5, 2), (4, 3)]} failed to produce all successors.
Missing successors are: [{'at-player': (5, 2), 'at-stone': [(5, 1), (4, 3)]}]
First think step by step why the successor function failed to produce all successors of the state.
Then, fix the successor function.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
The successor function failed to produce all successors because it only checked for pushing stones that are directly adjacent to the player and only considers stones that are in line with the player's position. In the specific grid case you provided, the stone at (5, 2) can be pushed to (5, 1) if the player moves to (5, 2) first, but this path was not fully explored. 

To ensure we capture all possible actions effectively, we need to handle both moving the player and pushing the stone more comprehensively. Hereâ€™s the corrected function:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(position):
        x, y = position
        return grid[x][y] == 0 or grid[x][y] == 2

    def move_player(new_position):
        return {
            'at-player': new_position,
            'at-stone': state['at-stone']
        }

    def push_stone(player_pos, stone_pos, new_stone_pos):
        stones = state['at-stone'][:]
        stones.remove(stone_pos)
        stones.append(new_stone_pos)
        return {
            'at-player': stone_pos,
            'at-stone': stones
        }

    player_pos = state['at-player']
    stone_positions = state['at-stone']
    successors = []

    directions = {
        'up': (-1, 0),
        'down': (1, 0),
        'left': (0, -1),
        'right': (0, 1)
    }

    for direction, (dx, dy) in directions.items():
        new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + dx, player_pos[1] + dy)

        if is_clear(new_player_pos):  # Move
            successors.append(move_player(new_player_pos))

            # Check if there is a stone to push after moving
            for stone_pos in stone_positions:
                if stone_pos == new_player_pos:
                    # Check if we can push the stone further in the same direction
                    new_stone_pos = (stone_pos[0] + dx, stone_pos[1] + dy)
                    if is_clear(new_stone_pos):  # Push
                        successors.append(push_stone(new_player_pos, stone_pos, new_stone_pos))

    return successors
``` 

This correction ensures that after moving the player, we check if they are positioned next to a stone and can then push the stone into a clear space.
