AutoToS prompt:

This domain models the classic Sokoban game, where the robot needs to move around and push stones to specific locations while adhering to the constraints defined by the walls in the maze. 
The maze is defined by a grid of values 0,1, and 2, where 2 means it is a goal location for a stone, 1 means the cell is blocked, and either 0 or 2 means that the cell can be occupied. A cell is clear if it can be occupied, but is not occupied by either the player or any stone.

The actions are:

move: This action moves the player in a specified direction. To perform this action, the target location must be clear and adjacent to player's location. Performing this action will result in the player being at the target location and no longer at the starting location, meaning the starting location is now clear, while the target location is now not clear.

push: This action allows the player to push a stone in a specified direction. To perform this action, the player's location, the stone location, and the target location must line up in the same direction, and the target location must be clear. Performing the action results in player being at the stone's initial location and the stone is at the target location. Further, the player's previous location is clear, while the target location is not clear.

Assume that states are defined by a dictionary with keys at-player and at-stone. 
Here is an example of a state
{'at-player': (4, 4), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
Here is an example of the grid:
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

This implementation provides a function get_successor_states that takes a state and a grid as input and returns a list of immediate successor states. The function iterates over possible movements (up, down, left, right) and checks if the new player position is within grid boundaries and is clear. If the new player position is occupied by a stone, it checks if the new stone position is within grid boundaries and is clear, and creates a new state by pushing the stone. Otherwise, it creates a new state by moving the player. The function returns a list of these new states.
Note that this implementation assumes that the grid is a 2D list of integers, where 0 represents an empty cell, 1 represents a blocked cell, and 2 represents a goal location for a stone. The state is a dictionary with 'at-player' and 'at-stone' keys, where 'at-player' is a tuple representing the player's position and 'at-stone' is a list of tuples representing the stones' positions.
