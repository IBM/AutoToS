This domain models the classic Sokoban game, where the robot needs to move around and push stones to specific locations while adhering to the constraints defined by the walls in the maze. 
The maze is defined by a grid of values 0,1, and 2, where 2 means it is a goal location for a stone, 1 means the cell is blocked, and either 0 or 2 means that the cell can be occupied. A cell is clear if it can be occupied, but is not occupied by either the player or any stone.

The actions are:

move: This action moves the player in a specified direction. To perform this action, the target location must be clear and adjacent to player's location. Performing this action will result in the player being at the target location and no longer at the starting location, meaning the starting location is now clear, while the target location is now not clear.

push: This action allows the player to push a stone in a specified direction. To perform this action, the player's location, the stone location, and the target location must line up in the same direction, and the target location must be clear. Performing the action results in player being at the stone's initial location and the stone is at the target location. Further, the player's previous location is clear, while the target location is not clear.

Assume that states are defined by a dictionary with keys at-player and at-stone. 
Here is an example of a state
{'at-player': (4, 4), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
Here is an example of the grid:
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

Provide a Python implementation of successor states function, receiving a state and a grid and returning a list of immediate successor states.

Model response:
```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_within_bounds(position):
        return 0 <= position[0] < len(grid) and 0 <= position[1] < len(grid[0])
    
    def is_clear(position):
        return is_within_bounds(position) and (grid[position[0]][position[1]] == 0 or grid[position[0]][position[1]] == 2)

    def move_player(direction):
        dx, dy = direction
        new_player_position = (state['at-player'][0] + dx, state['at-player'][1] + dy)
        if is_clear(new_player_position):
            return {'at-player': new_player_position, 'at-stone': state['at-stone']}
        return None

    def push_stone(direction):
        dx, dy = direction
        current_player_position = state['at-player']

                stone_position[1] == current_player_position[1] + dy):
                new_stone_position = (stone_position[0] + dx, stone_position[1] + dy)
                if is_clear(new_stone_position):
                    new_stone_positions = [new_stone_position if pos == stone_position else pos for pos in current_stone_positions]
                    return {'at-player': stone_position, 'at-stone': new_stone_positions}
        return None

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # up, down, left, right
    successor_list = []

    for direction in directions:
        new_state = move_player(direction)
        if new_state is not None:
            successor_list.append(new_state)
        
        new_state = push_stone(direction)
        if new_state is not None:
            successor_list.append(new_state)

    return successor_list
```

AutoToS prompt:

    Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state for a given goal configuration. Assume that the goal configuration is provided by the 2-dimensional array as before. The function should receive a state and the 2-dimensional array and return True if the state is a goal state and False otherwise.
    
Model response:
```python
def is_goal_state(state, goal_configuration):
    def is_goal(location):
        return goal_configuration[location[0]][location[1]] == 2

    for stone_position in state['at-stone']:
        if not is_goal(stone_position):
            return False
    return True

Invalid transition: a stone and the player are at the same location.
Let's think step by step. First think through in words why the successor function produced a successor that has a stone and the player at the same location. Then provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that ensures that in all successors the player and the stones are at different locations.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Input state: {'at-player': (4, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
Example wrong successor state: {'at-player': (3, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}

Model response:
The issue with the previous implementation of the successor function is that it did not check if the player's new position (after a move or a push) would collide with any stones. This can lead to invalid states where the player and a stone occupy the same position. The revised function will ensure that after each action, the player and stones are at different locations.

Here is the complete revised Python code for the successor function:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_within_bounds(position):
        return 0 <= position[0] < len(grid) and 0 <= position[1] < len(grid[0])
    
    def is_clear(position):
        return is_within_bounds(position) and (grid[position[0]][position[1]] == 0 or grid[position[0]][position[1]] == 2)

    def move_player(direction):
        dx, dy = direction
        new_player_position = (state['at-player'][0] + dx, state['at-player'][1] + dy)
        
        if is_clear(new_player_position) and new_player_position not in state['at-stone']:
            return {'at-player': new_player_position, 'at-stone': state['at-stone']}
        return None

    def push_stone(direction):
        dx, dy = direction
        current_player_position = state['at-player']
        current_stone_positions = state['at-stone']
        
        for stone_position in current_stone_positions:
            if (stone_position[0] == current_player_position[0] + dx and 
                stone_position[1] == current_player_position[1] + dy):
                new_stone_position = (stone_position[0] + dx, stone_position[1] + dy)
                if is_clear(new_stone_position) and new_stone_position not in current_stone_positions:
                    new_stone_positions = [new_stone_position if pos == stone_position else pos for pos in current_stone_positions]
                    return {'at-player': stone_position, 'at-stone': new_stone_positions}
        return None

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # up, down, left, right
    successor_list = []

    for direction in directions:
        new_state = move_player(direction)
        if new_state is not None:

        new_state = push_stone(direction)
        if new_state is not None:
            successor_list.append(new_state)
