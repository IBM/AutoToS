This domain models the classic Sokoban game, where the robot needs to move around and push stones to specific locations while adhering to the constraints defined by the walls in the maze. 
The maze is defined by a grid of values 0,1, and 2, where 2 means it is a goal location for a stone, 1 means the cell is blocked, and either 0 or 2 means that the cell can be occupied. A cell is clear if it can be occupied, but is not occupied by either the player or any stone.

The actions are:

move: This action moves the player in a specified direction. To perform this action, the target location must be clear and adjacent to player's location. Performing this action will result in the player being at the target location and no longer at the starting location, meaning the starting location is now clear, while the target location is now not clear.

push: This action allows the player to push a stone in a specified direction. To perform this action, the player's location, the stone location, and the target location must line up in the same direction, and the target location must be clear. Performing the action results in player being at the stone's initial location and the stone is at the target location. Further, the player's previous location is clear, while the target location is not clear.

Assume that states are defined by a dictionary with keys at-player and at-stone. 
Here is an example of a state
{'at-player': (4, 4), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
Here is an example of the grid:
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

Provide a Python implementation of successor states function, receiving a state and a grid and returning a list of immediate successor states.

AutoToS prompt:

    Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state for a given goal configuration. Assume that the goal configuration is provided by the 2-dimensional array as before. The function should receive a state and the 2-dimensional array and return True if the state is a goal state and False otherwise.

def is_goal_state(state, goal_grid):

Invalid transition: a stone and the player are at the same location.
Let's think step by step. First think through in words why the successor function produced a successor that has a stone and the player at the same location. Then provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that ensures that in all successors the player and the stones are at different locations.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Input state: {'at-player': (4, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
Example wrong successor state: {'at-player': (3, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}

Model response:
The issue with the original successor function was that it allowed for a successor state where the player and a stone could occupy the same location after a push action. This happens in scenarios where a player pushes a stone into the position where they are currently standing. The function should ensure that the player cannot occupy the same cell as any stone in the resulting successor states.

To fix this, I will add a check that verifies the new position of the player after a move or push action does not coincide with the position of any stone.

Here is the revised Python code for the `successor_states` function:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    from typing import List, Tuple

    def is_clear(position: Tuple[int, int]) -> bool:
        x, y = position
        return grid[x][y] == 0 or grid[x][y] == 2

    def move_player(direction: Tuple[int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        player_pos = state['at-player']
        new_player_pos = (player_pos[0] + direction[0], player_pos[1] + direction[1])
        return new_player_pos

    def push_stone(direction: Tuple[int, int], stone_index: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        stone_pos = state['at-stone'][stone_index]
        new_stone_pos = (stone_pos[0] + direction[0], stone_pos[1] + direction[1])
        return new_stone_pos

    directions = {
        'up': (-1, 0),
        'down': (1, 0),
        'left': (0, -1),
        'right': (0, 1)
    }

    successor_states = []

    for direction in directions.values():
        # Check if player can move
        new_player_pos = move_player(direction)
        if is_clear(new_player_pos) and new_player_pos not in state['at-stone']:
            successor_states.append({
                'at-player': new_player_pos,
                'at-stone': state['at-stone'][:]
            })

        # Check if player can push any stone
        for i, stone_pos in enumerate(state['at-stone']):
            if (stone_pos[0], stone_pos[1]) == (state['at-player'][0] + direction[0], state['at-player'][1] + direction[1]):
                new_stone_pos = push_stone(direction, i)
                if is_clear(new_stone_pos) and new_stone_pos not in state['at-stone']:
                    new_at_stone = state['at-stone'][:]
                    new_at_stone[i] = new_stone_pos
                    successor_states.append({
                        'at-player': stone_pos,
                        'at-stone': new_at_stone
                    })

    return successor_states
```
