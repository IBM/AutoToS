This domain models the classic Sokoban game, where the robot needs to move around and push stones to specific locations while adhering to the constraints defined by the walls in the maze. 
The maze is defined by a grid of values 0,1, and 2, where 2 means it is a goal location for a stone, 1 means the cell is blocked, and either 0 or 2 means that the cell can be occupied. A cell is clear if it can be occupied, but is not occupied by either the player or any stone.

The actions are:

move: This action moves the player in a specified direction. To perform this action, the target location must be clear and adjacent to player's location. Performing this action will result in the player being at the target location and no longer at the starting location, meaning the starting location is now clear, while the target location is now not clear.

push: This action allows the player to push a stone in a specified direction. To perform this action, the player's location, the stone location, and the target location must line up in the same direction, and the target location must be clear. Performing the action results in player being at the stone's initial location and the stone is at the target location. Further, the player's previous location is clear, while the target location is not clear.

Assume that states are defined by a dictionary with keys at-player and at-stone. 
Here is an example of a state
{'at-player': (4, 4), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
Here is an example of the grid:
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

Invalid transition: a stone and the player are at the same location.
Let's think step by step. First think through in words why the successor function produced a successor that has a stone and the player at the same location. Then provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that ensures that in all successors the player and the stones are at different locations.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Input state: {'at-player': (4, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
Example wrong successor state: {'at-player': (3, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}

Model response:
The issue arises when the successor function allows the player to move to a location that is occupied by a stone, specifically during the pushing action, which can mistakenly result in the player and the stone being at the same position. The logic needs to ensure that after any action, the player and stones do not occupy the same location.

Here is the revised Python code for the successor function that addresses this issue:

```python

        return (0 <= target_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= target_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

    def can_push(dir):

            new_state = {
                'at-player': (new_player_x, new_player_y),

Example wrong successor state: {'at-player': (3, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}

Model response:
The issue arises from the way the successor function handles the push action. When attempting to push a stone, the function inadvertently allows the player to occupy the same cell as a stone after the push. This is especially problematic if the player's new position after a push is the same as the stone's new position. 

To resolve this, we must ensure that any new state generated in the successor function maintains distinct positions for the player and any stones after the execution of actions. I will adjust the logic accordingly to prevent this situation from occurring.

Here is the corrected Python code for the successor function:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        x, y = pos
        return grid[x][y] == 0 or grid[x][y] == 2

    def is_stone_at(pos):
        return pos in state['at-stone']

    def can_move(dir):
        player_x, player_y = state['at-player']
        target_x, target_y = player_x + dir[0], player_y + dir[1]
        return (0 <= target_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= target_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

    def can_push(dir):
        player_x, player_y = state['at-player']
        stone_x, stone_y = player_x + dir[0], player_y + dir[1]
        target_x, target_y = stone_x + dir[0], stone_y + dir[1]
        return (0 <= stone_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= stone_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                is_stone_at((stone_x, stone_y)) and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    successor_states = []

    for dir in directions:
        if can_move(dir):
            new_player_x = state['at-player'][0] + dir[0]
            new_player_y = state['at-player'][1] + dir[1]
            new_state = {
                'at-player': (new_player_x, new_player_y),
                'at-stone': state['at-stone']
            }
            successor_states.append(new_state)

        if can_push(dir):
            stone_x = state['at-player'][0] + dir[0]
            stone_y = state['at-player'][1] + dir[1]
            new_stone_x = stone_x + dir[0]
            new_stone_y = stone_y + dir[1]
            if (stone_x, stone_y) != state['at-player']:  # Ensure player and stone are not in the same position
                new_state = {
                    'at-player': (stone_x, stone_y),
                    'at-stone': [(new_stone_x, new_stone_y) if (x, y) == (stone_x, stone_y) else (x, y) for x, y in state['at-stone'] if (x, y) != (stone_x, stone_y)]
                }
                successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
``` 

This implementation ensures that all transitions respect the distinction between the player's and the stones' positions and that they do not occupy the same cell after any action.

Example wrong successor state: {'at-player': (3, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}

Model response:
The mistake in the previous implementation is still due to how we handled the player and stone movements, particularly in the scenario where the player pushes a stone. If the player moves to the location where the stone was pushed from, they could end up occupying the same cell as a stone, resulting in an invalid state. This must be prevented by ensuring that when generating successor states, the player and stones never overlap.

Let's refine the `successor_states` function further by implementing the following changes:
- Ensure that after every valid operation, the player's position does not equal the position of any stone.

Here’s the revised Python code that incorporates these fixes:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        x, y = pos
        return grid[x][y] == 0 or grid[x][y] == 2

    def can_move(dir):
        player_x, player_y = state['at-player']
        target_x, target_y = player_x + dir[0], player_y + dir[1]
        return (0 <= target_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= target_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

    def can_push(dir):
        player_x, player_y = state['at-player']
        stone_x, stone_y = player_x + dir[0], player_y + dir[1]
        target_x, target_y = stone_x + dir[0], stone_y + dir[1]
        return (0 <= stone_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= stone_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                (stone_x, stone_y) in state['at-stone'] and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    successor_states = []

    for dir in directions:
        if can_move(dir):
            new_player_x = state['at-player'][0] + dir[0]
            new_player_y = state['at-player'][1] + dir[1]
            new_state = {
                'at-player': (new_player_x, new_player_y),
                'at-stone': state['at-stone']
            }
            successor_states.append(new_state)

        if can_push(dir):
            stone_x = state['at-player'][0] + dir[0]
            stone_y = state['at-player'][1] + dir[1]
            new_stone_x = stone_x + dir[0]
            new_stone_y = stone_y + dir[1]
            
            # Create new state after pushing
            new_state = {
                'at-player': (stone_x, stone_y),
                'at-stone': [(new_stone_x, new_stone_y) if (x, y) == (stone_x, stone_y) else (x, y) for x, y in state['at-stone']]
            }
            
            # Ensure that the player and stones are not in the same position
            if new_state['at-player'] not in new_state['at-stone']:
                successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```

In this code:

- The `is_clear` function checks if a position is unoccupied.
- The `can_move` function checks if the player can move to an adjacent cell.
- The `can_push` function verifies if the player can push a stone to an adjacent cell.
- After pushing, we create a new state and check that the player's new position does not coincide with any stone's position before adding it to the successor states.

This ensures that an invalid transition where the player and stone occupy the same location can no longer occur.

Example wrong successor state: {'at-player': (3, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}

Model response:
The persistent issue with the successor function arises when the push operation allows the player to occupy the same cell as the stone after the push is executed. This typically occurs because we set the player's position to where the stone is after a push without first confirming that it doesn't overlap with any other stone's position.

To effectively resolve this issue, we need to ensure that:
1. When pushing a stone, the new position of the player must not be the same as the new position of the pushed stone.
2. We will also ensure that the state of the game reflects this properly with no overlap.

Here is the corrected Python code for the successor function that guarantees the player and the stones are in distinct locations:

```python

            if (new_stone_x, new_stone_y) != state['at-player']:  # Ensure player and stone are not in the same position
                # Create new state with a pushed stone
                new_state = {
                    'at-player': (stone_x, stone_y),
                    'at-stone': [(new_stone_x, new_stone_y) if (x, y) == (stone_x, stone_y) else (x, y) for x, y in state['at-stone']]
                }
                successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```

### Key Changes Made:
- **Check for Overlap:** After determining where the stone will be pushed to, we ensure that the new player's position (after pushing) is not the same as where the stone will end up.
- **Separation of States:** The new state formed after a push reflects whether the player is at the stone's previous location, maintaining the rule that they should not occupy the same cell.

This implementation should effectively prevent the scenarios where the player and stone occupy the same cell, ensuring all successor states are valid.

Invalid transition: a stone and the player are at the same location.
Let's think step by step. First think through in words why the successor function produced a successor that has a stone and the player at the same location. Then provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that ensures that in all successors the player and the stones are at different locations.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Input state: {'at-player': (4, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
Example wrong successor state: {'at-player': (3, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}

Model response:
The recurring issue with the current successor function seems to be the logic surrounding how the player's new position is handled during the push operation. Specifically, the problem arises when we allow the player to end up in a position where a stone was just pushed, thus leading to an invalid state where the player and stone occupy the same coordinates.

To ensure the successor function correctly prevents this scenario, I will make the following changes:
- Verify the positions of both the player and the stone after a move or push. If any successor configuration results in them occupying the same cell, that configuration should be discarded.

Here's the corrected implementation that addresses these points:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        x, y = pos
        return grid[x][y] == 0 or grid[x][y] == 2

    def can_move(dir):
        player_x, player_y = state['at-player']
        target_x, target_y = player_x + dir[0], player_y + dir[1]
        return (0 <= target_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= target_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

    def can_push(dir):
        player_x, player_y = state['at-player']
        stone_x, stone_y = player_x + dir[0], player_y + dir[1]
        target_x, target_y = stone_x + dir[0], stone_y + dir[1]
        return (0 <= stone_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= stone_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                (stone_x, stone_y) in state['at-stone'] and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    successor_states = []

    for dir in directions:
        if can_move(dir):
            new_player_x = state['at-player'][0] + dir[0]
            new_player_y = state['at-player'][1] + dir[1]
            new_state = {
                'at-player': (new_player_x, new_player_y),
                'at-stone': state['at-stone']
            }
            successor_states.append(new_state)

        if can_push(dir):
            stone_x = state['at-player'][0] + dir[0]
            stone_y = state['at-player'][1] + dir[1]
            new_stone_x = stone_x + dir[0]
            new_stone_y = stone_y + dir[1]

            if (new_stone_x, new_stone_y) != state['at-player']:  # Ensure player and stone do not occupy the same cell
                new_state = {
                    'at-player': (stone_x, stone_y),
                    'at-stone': [(new_stone_x, new_stone_y) if (x, y) == (stone_x, stone_y) else (x, y) for x, y in state['at-stone']]
                }
                successor_states.append(new_state)

    # Filter out any states where the player is at a stone's position
    valid_successor_states = []
    for s in successor_states:
        if s['at-player'] not in s['at-stone']:
            valid_successor_states.append(s)

    return valid_successor_states
```

### Key Updates:
- After generating possible successor states, I added a filter that explicitly checks if the player's position coincides with any of the stones' positions. Only the valid states are retained for return.
- Ensured the condition that checks for overlapping player and stone positions is robust and executed systematically after each movement or push action.

With these changes, the function should prevent any situations where the player and stone occupy the same cell, thus avoiding invalid transitions altogether.

Invalid transition: multiple stones at the same location.
Let's think step by step. First think through in words why the successor function produced a successor that has two stones at the same location. Then provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that ensures that in all successors all stones are at different locations.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Input state: {'at-player': (2, 1), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (2, 3)]}
Example wrong successor state: {'at-player': (2, 2), 'at-stone': [(2, 3), (2, 3)]}

Model response:
The issue of multiple stones being reported at the same location typically arises from the logic used to update the stones' positions after a push operation. When a stone is pushed, the code should ensure that it doesn't duplicate the position of another stone that already exists in that position.

To prevent this from happening, we need to modify the way we construct the list of stones after a push action. Specifically, after pushing a stone to a new position, we should:
1. Ensure that the new position of the pushed stone does not already contain another stone.
2. Create a new list of stone positions that incorporates this change while preventing duplicates.

Here’s the corrected implementation of the `successor_states` function:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        x, y = pos
        return grid[x][y] == 0 or grid[x][y] == 2

    def can_move(dir):
        player_x, player_y = state['at-player']
        target_x, target_y = player_x + dir[0], player_y + dir[1]
        return (0 <= target_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= target_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

    def can_push(dir):
        player_x, player_y = state['at-player']
        stone_x, stone_y = player_x + dir[0], player_y + dir[1]
        target_x, target_y = stone_x + dir[0], stone_y + dir[1]
        return (0 <= stone_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= stone_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                (stone_x, stone_y) in state['at-stone'] and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    successor_states = []

    for dir in directions:
        if can_move(dir):
            new_player_x = state['at-player'][0] + dir[0]
            new_player_y = state['at-player'][1] + dir[1]
            new_state = {
                'at-player': (new_player_x, new_player_y),
                'at-stone': state['at-stone']
            }
            successor_states.append(new_state)

        if can_push(dir):
            stone_x = state['at-player'][0] + dir[0]
            stone_y = state['at-player'][1] + dir[1]
            new_stone_x = stone_x + dir[0]
            new_stone_y = stone_y + dir[1]

            # Only push if the new stone position is unique
            if (new_stone_x, new_stone_y) not in state['at-stone']:
                new_state = {
                    'at-player': (stone_x, stone_y),
                    'at-stone': [(new_stone_x, new_stone_y) if (x, y) == (stone_x, stone_y) else (x, y) for x, y in state['at-stone']]
                }
                
                # Ensure to remove the instance of the stone that was pushed.
                new_state['at-stone'] = list(set(new_state['at-stone']))  # Ensure all stones are unique
                successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Unique Position Verification:** The code checks to ensure that the new position of the stone being pushed does not already exist in the current list of stones (`state['at-stone']`).
2. **Removing Duplicates:** After creating the new state with the pushed stone, the code explicitly converts the `at-stone` list to a set and back to a list. This ensures that all positions are unique and no stone shares the same coordinate after pushes.

By applying these fixes, we can ensure that the successor states generated will not contain multiple stones at the same location, and we maintain the integrity of the game state in the Sokoban problem.

Example wrong successor state: {'at-player': (3, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}

Model response:
The issue with the previous successor function implementations arises primarily from the handling of pushing stones and the resulting conditions on player and stone positions. The player may inadvertently occupy the same position as a stone during a push operation, leading to an invalid state.

To solve this issue, we need to:
1. Ensure that after pushing a stone, the player's new position should not be the same as the new position of any stone.
2. Create the successor state carefully to reflect the new positions without overlaps.

Here's the revised implementation of the successor state function, ensuring that the player and stone cannot occupy the same location:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        x, y = pos
        return grid[x][y] == 0 or grid[x][y] == 2

        return (0 <= target_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= target_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

    def can_push(dir):
        player_x, player_y = state['at-player']
        stone_x, stone_y = player_x + dir[0], player_y + dir[1]
        target_x, target_y = stone_x + dir[0], stone_y + dir[1]
        return (0 <= stone_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= stone_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                (stone_x, stone_y) in state['at-stone'] and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    successor_states = []

    for dir in directions:
        if can_move(dir):
            new_player_x = state['at-player'][0] + dir[0]
            new_player_y = state['at-player'][1] + dir[1]
            new_state = {
                'at-player': (new_player_x, new_player_y),
                'at-stone': state['at-stone']
            }
            successor_states.append(new_state)

        if can_push(dir):
            stone_x = state['at-player'][0] + dir[0]
            stone_y = state['at-player'][1] + dir[1]
            new_stone_x = stone_x + dir[0]
            new_stone_y = stone_y + dir[1]

            if (new_stone_x, new_stone_y) not in state['at-stone'] and (stone_x, stone_y) != (state['at-player'][0], state['at-player'][1]):
                # Create new state with pushed stone
                new_state = {
                    'at-player': (stone_x, stone_y),
                    'at-stone': [(new_stone_x, new_stone_y) if (x, y) == (stone_x, stone_y) else (x, y) for x, y in state['at-stone']]
                }
                
                # Ensure the player's new position doesn’t overlap with stones
                if new_state['at-player'] not in new_state['at-stone']:
                    successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Position Check After Pushing:** When creating the new state after a push, we verify that the new position of the player does not equal the new position of any stone.
2. **Filtering Invalid States:** Added logic to filter out states where the player and any stone occupy the same position.

With these checks implemented, we ensure that the generated successor states do not contain invalid configurations. This should keep the player's and stones' positions distinct across all successors.

Example wrong successor state: {'at-player': (3, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}

Model response:
To address the problem of generating successor states where the player and stones can end up occupying the same cell, we need to carefully analyze the movement and pushing mechanics within the function. 

Here's a logical breakdown of how the problem arises:
1. When a player pushes a stone, they move to the position where the stone was initially located.
2. If the new position (where the player moves after the push) overlaps with a stone (either the pushed stone or another stone), it results in an invalid state where both the stone and player occupy the same cell.

To resolve this, we can implement the following checks:
- Ensure that during the push operation, after determining the new position of the stone, we check if the player is landing in a position that is either occupied by the pushed stone or any other stone.

Here’s the corrected version of the function:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        x, y = pos
        return grid[x][y] == 0 or grid[x][y] == 2

        return (0 <= target_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= target_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

        target_x, target_y = stone_x + dir[0], stone_y + dir[1]
        return (0 <= stone_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= stone_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                (stone_x, stone_y) in state['at-stone'] and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    successor_states = []

    for dir in directions:
        # Handle moving the player
        if can_move(dir):
            new_player_x = state['at-player'][0] + dir[0]
            new_player_y = state['at-player'][1] + dir[1]
            new_state = {
                'at-player': (new_player_x, new_player_y),
                'at-stone': state['at-stone']
            }
            successor_states.append(new_state)

        # Handle pushing a stone
        if can_push(dir):
            stone_x = state['at-player'][0] + dir[0]
            stone_y = state['at-player'][1] + dir[1]
            new_stone_x = stone_x + dir[0]
            new_stone_y = stone_y + dir[1]

            # Create new state with the stone pushed
            new_state = {
                'at-player': (stone_x, stone_y),
                'at-stone': [(new_stone_x, new_stone_y) if (x, y) == (stone_x, stone_y) else (x, y) for x, y in state['at-stone']]
            }

            # Ensure the player does not occupy the same cell as any of the stones
            if new_state['at-player'] not in new_state['at-stone']:
                successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```

### Key Updates:
1. **Clear Function**: Remains the same, verifying whether a cell is clear for movement.
2. **Move and Push Checks**: Continues as in previous iterations, ensuring valid movements.
3. **New State Creation**: When creating a new state after a push, we ensure that the player's position does not overlap with any stone's position, including the stone that was just pushed.

With these checks in place, the functionality should prevent the alleged cases of overlapping player and stone positions, avoiding invalid game states in the Sokoban implementation. 

The adjustments in this code ensure that:
- **After pushing a stone**, the new player position is validated against all stone positions to ensure a valid game state.

Example wrong successor state: {'at-player': (3, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}

Model response:
The problem of having a stone and the player at the same location stems from the logic in the function when handling the push action. Specifically, the player might end up occupying the cell where the stone was moved from without proper validation.

### Analysis:
1. **Push Action**: When the player pushes a stone to a new position, the player moves into the position previously occupied by the stone.
2. **Invalid States**: If the new position of the player overlaps with the position of any stone (especially the one that was just pushed), it results in an invalid state.

### Solution
We need to ensure that after performing a push, the player's new position cannot equal the new position of the stone or any other stone. 

### Here’s the revised implementation of the `successor_states` function that enforces this rule:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        x, y = pos
        return grid[x][y] == 0 or grid[x][y] == 2

    def can_move(dir):
        player_x, player_y = state['at-player']
        target_x, target_y = player_x + dir[0], player_y + dir[1]
        return (0 <= target_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= target_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

    def can_push(dir):
        player_x, player_y = state['at-player']
        stone_x, stone_y = player_x + dir[0], player_y + dir[1]
        target_x, target_y = stone_x + dir[0], stone_y + dir[1]
        return (0 <= stone_x < len(grid) and 
                0 <= stone_y < len(grid[0]) and 
                (stone_x, stone_y) in state['at-stone'] and 
                is_clear((target_x, target_y)))

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    successor_states = []

    for dir in directions:
        # Check player movement
        if can_move(dir):
            new_player_x = state['at-player'][0] + dir[0]
            new_player_y = state['at-player'][1] + dir[1]
            new_state = {
                'at-player': (new_player_x, new_player_y),
                'at-stone': state['at-stone']
            }
            successor_states.append(new_state)

        # Check stone pushing
        if can_push(dir):
            stone_x = state['at-player'][0] + dir[0]
            stone_y = state['at-player'][1] + dir[1]
            new_stone_x = stone_x + dir[0]
            new_stone_y = stone_y + dir[1]

            # Create the new state with the stone moved
            new_state = {
                'at-player': (stone_x, stone_y),
                'at-stone': [(new_stone_x, new_stone_y) if (x, y) == (stone_x, stone_y) else (x, y) for x, y in state['at-stone']]
            }

            # Check for overlapping positions
            if new_state['at-player'] not in new_state['at-stone'] and (new_stone_x, new_stone_y) != new_state['at-player']:
                successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Check Stone Position**: When creating the `new_state` for a push, we check that the player's position (after the push) does not overlap with any stone's position.
2. **Prevent the Player from Moving to a Stone's Location**: The code explicitly checks if the player's position after the push is the same as the new stone position before adding the successor state.

With these changes, the function should now correctly prevent any unlawful configurations where stones and the player occupy the same cell after any actions are taken. This will ensure the integrity of the game states generated in the Sokoban problem.
