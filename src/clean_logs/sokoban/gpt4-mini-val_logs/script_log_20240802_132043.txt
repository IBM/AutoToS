This domain models the classic Sokoban game, where the robot needs to move around and push stones to specific locations while adhering to the constraints defined by the walls in the maze. 
The maze is defined by a grid of values 0,1, and 2, where 2 means it is a goal location for a stone, 1 means the cell is blocked, and either 0 or 2 means that the cell can be occupied. A cell is clear if it can be occupied, but is not occupied by either the player or any stone.

The actions are:

move: This action moves the player in a specified direction. To perform this action, the target location must be clear and adjacent to player's location. Performing this action will result in the player being at the target location and no longer at the starting location, meaning the starting location is now clear, while the target location is now not clear.

push: This action allows the player to push a stone in a specified direction. To perform this action, the player's location, the stone location, and the target location must line up in the same direction, and the target location must be clear. Performing the action results in player being at the stone's initial location and the stone is at the target location. Further, the player's previous location is clear, while the target location is not clear.

Assume that states are defined by a dictionary with keys at-player and at-stone. 
Here is an example of a state
{'at-player': (4, 4), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
Here is an example of the grid:
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

Invalid transition: a stone and the player are at the same location.
Let's think step by step. First think through in words why the successor function produced a successor that has a stone and the player at the same location. Then provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that ensures that in all successors the player and the stones are at different locations.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Input state: {'at-player': (4, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
Example wrong successor state: {'at-player': (3, 3), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}

Model response:
The previous implementation of the `successor_states` function did not ensure that the player and any stone would not occupy the same position after performing a move or a push action. This can occur when the player pushes a stone, which then results in the player's position being occupied by that stone, leading to an invalid state.

To fix this, we need to add a check when generating new states to ensure that the player's position and the stonesâ€™ positions do not overlap. The corrected successor function will incorporate this validation.

Here's the revised code:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        return grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] in [0, 2]

    def can_push(player_pos, stone_pos, target_pos):
        return (stone_pos[0] + direction[0] == target_pos[0] and 
                stone_pos[1] + direction[1] == target_pos[1] and 
                is_clear(target_pos))

    directions = {
        'up': (-1, 0), 
        'down': (1, 0), 
        'left': (0, -1), 
        'right': (0, 1)
    }
    
    successor_states = []
    player_pos = state['at-player']
    
    for direction in directions.values():
        # Move
        target_pos = (player_pos[0] + direction[0], player_pos[1] + direction[1])
        if is_clear(target_pos):
            new_state = {'at-player': target_pos, 'at-stone': state['at-stone']}
            if all(new_state['at-player'] != stone for stone in new_state['at-stone']):
                successor_states.append(new_state)

        # Push
        for idx, stone_pos in enumerate(state['at-stone']):
            if (stone_pos[0] == player_pos[0] + direction[0] and 
                stone_pos[1] == player_pos[1] + direction[1]):
                target_pos_after_push = (stone_pos[0] + direction[0], stone_pos[1] + direction[1])
                if can_push(player_pos, stone_pos, target_pos_after_push):
                    new_stones = state['at-stone'][:]
                    new_stones[idx] = target_pos_after_push

Let's think step by step. First think through in words why the successor function produced a successor that has two stones at the same location. Then provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that ensures that in all successors all stones are at different locations.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Example wrong successor state: {'at-player': (2, 2), 'at-stone': [(2, 3), (2, 3)]}

Model response:
The issue with the previous implementation is that when pushing a stone, there was no validation to ensure that a stone would not end up at the same location as another stone. If a stone is pushed to a location where another stone already exists, the resulting state would contain duplicates in the `at-stone` list, which is not allowed in the Sokoban game.

To fix this problem, we need to check that after performing a push action, no two stones occupy the same position in the successor state. We can achieve this by adding a condition that checks for duplicates in the list of stones when creating a new state.

Here's the revised code with these checks implemented:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        return grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] in [0, 2]

    def can_push(player_pos, stone_pos, target_pos):
        return (stone_pos[0] + direction[0] == target_pos[0] and 
                stone_pos[1] + direction[1] == target_pos[1] and 
                is_clear(target_pos))

    directions = {
        'up': (-1, 0), 
        'down': (1, 0), 
        'left': (0, -1), 
        'right': (0, 1)
    }
    
    successor_states = []
    player_pos = state['at-player']
    
    for direction in directions.values():
        # Move
        target_pos = (player_pos[0] + direction[0], player_pos[1] + direction[1])
        if is_clear(target_pos):
            new_state = {'at-player': target_pos, 'at-stone': state['at-stone']}
            if all(new_state['at-player'] != stone for stone in new_state['at-stone']):
                successor_states.append(new_state)

                target_pos_after_push = (stone_pos[0] + direction[0], stone_pos[1] + direction[1])
                if can_push(player_pos, stone_pos, target_pos_after_push):

Then, fix the successor function.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
The previous implementation of the `successor_states` function likely failed to account for all possible scenarios of moving and pushing stones. Specifically, when a player can either move into a clear space or push a stone, the logic needs to be structured to explore both options effectively.

In the example you provided, the successor function should not only move the player but also push a stone to an adjacent clear space if such an action is valid. The omission of certain successors may arise from the failure to evaluate or add all possible valid states after performing each action.

To improve this, we will ensure that:
1. The function checks for all possible moves for the player and pushes for each stone individually.
2. It also checks if the action of pushing a stone results in that stone being moved to a clear location.

Hereâ€™s the revised code:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        return grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] in [0, 2]

        'down': (1, 0), 
        'left': (0, -1), 
        'right': (0, 1)
    }
    
    successor_states = []
    player_pos = state['at-player']
    
    for direction in directions.values():
        # Move
        target_pos = (player_pos[0] + direction[0], player_pos[1] + direction[1])
        if is_clear(target_pos):
            new_state = {'at-player': target_pos, 'at-stone': state['at-stone']}

                    break
            else:
                # Only consider pushing the stone if valid

                    new_stones = state['at-stone'][:]
                    new_stones[idx] = target_pos_after_push
                    if (target_pos_after_push not in new_stones and 
                        all(target_pos_after_push != other_stone for other_stone in new_stones if other_stone != stone_pos)):
                        new_state = {'at-player': stone_pos, 'at-stone': new_stones}

AutoToS prompt:
The following exception was produced when testing the successor function: 
  File "<string>", line 47, in successor_states

cannot access local variable 'target_pos_after_push' where it is not associated with a value. Please fix this exception in the successor function.
Model response:
The exception you're encountering is due to the usage of the `target_pos_after_push` variable outside of its defined scope. Specifically, the code tries to use `target_pos_after_push` in the nested loop where it checks for additional opportunities to push, but it may not have been initialized in every code path.

To resolve this, we should ensure that `target_pos_after_push` is properly defined and utilized within the context where it's relevant. We can simplify the logic by directly focusing on valid push conditions without needing unnecessary checks.

Here is the corrected version of the `successor_states` function, ensuring that all necessary variables are defined and the logic flows correctly:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        return grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] in [0, 2]

        'right': (0, 1)
    }
    
    successor_states = []
    player_pos = state['at-player']
    
    for direction in directions.values():
        # Move
        target_pos = (player_pos[0] + direction[0], player_pos[1] + direction[1])
        if is_clear(target_pos):
            new_state = {'at-player': target_pos, 'at-stone': state['at-stone']}
            if new_state['at-player'] not in new_state['at-stone']:
                successor_states.append(new_state)

        # Push
        for idx, stone_pos in enumerate(state['at-stone']):
            if (stone_pos[0] == player_pos[0] + direction[0] and 
                stone_pos[1] == player_pos[1] + direction[1]):
                
                target_pos_after_push = (stone_pos[0] + direction[0], stone_pos[1] + direction[1])
                if is_clear(target_pos_after_push):
                    new_stones = state['at-stone'][:]
                    new_stones[idx] = target_pos_after_push

                    # Check if pushing the stone results in any stone being in the same position
                    if (new_stones.count(target_pos_after_push) == 1 and 
                        all(target_pos_after_push != other_stone for other_stone in new_stones if other_stone != stone_pos)):
                        new_state = {'at-player': stone_pos, 'at-stone': new_stones}
                        if new_state['at-player'] != target_pos_after_push and all(new_state['at-player'] != stone for stone in new_state['at-stone']):
                            successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```

In this revision:
- The nested logic for checking push actions is streamlined so that the variable `target_pos_after_push` is always defined where it's used.
- The condition to ensure that the states are valid has been consolidated, ensuring no duplications of stones occur and all checks are locally scoped to their relevant blocks. 

This implementation should resolve the exception while also capturing all valid successor states correctly.

Model response:
The failure to produce all successors in the previous `successor_states` implementation is likely because it only considered one valid push per iteration. In the context of the Sokoban game, if a stone can be pushed into a valid empty cell, that action should also be recognized as a potential successor. The function was not effectively exploring the possibilities, especially for situations where pushing a stone may lead to additional valid moves.

Here's how we can correct this:
1. Ensure that when checking for valid push actions, we do so for every stone, allowing for the player to determine if another stone can potentially be pushed as a result of the first push action.
2. Properly manage the checks to ensure that any stone moved into a location does not overlap with another stone.

Here's the corrected version of the `successor_states` function:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        return grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] in [0, 2]

    directions = {
        'up': (-1, 0), 
        'down': (1, 0), 
        'left': (0, -1), 
        'right': (0, 1)
    }
    
    successor_states = []
    player_pos = state['at-player']
    
    for direction in directions.values():
        # Move
        target_pos = (player_pos[0] + direction[0], player_pos[1] + direction[1])
        if is_clear(target_pos):
            new_state = {'at-player': target_pos, 'at-stone': state['at-stone']}
            if new_state['at-player'] not in new_state['at-stone']:
                successor_states.append(new_state)

        # Push
        for idx, stone_pos in enumerate(state['at-stone']):
            if (stone_pos[0] == player_pos[0] + direction[0] and 
                stone_pos[1] == player_pos[1] + direction[1]):
                
                target_pos_after_push = (stone_pos[0] + direction[0], stone_pos[1] + direction[1])
                # Check if the position after the push is clear
                if is_clear(target_pos_after_push):
                    new_stones = state['at-stone'][:]
                    new_stones[idx] = target_pos_after_push
                    
                    # Check for duplicates of stones
                    if (new_stones.count(target_pos_after_push) == 1 
                        and all(target_pos_after_push != other_stone for other_stone in new_stones if other_stone != stone_pos)):
                        
                        new_state = {'at-player': stone_pos, 'at-stone': new_stones}
                        if new_state['at-player'] != target_pos_after_push and all(new_state['at-player'] != stone for stone in new_state['at-stone']):
                            successor_states.append(new_state)

                        # Also push if there are valid configurations for the other stones
                        for jdx, other_stone_pos in enumerate(state['at-stone']):
                            if jdx != idx and other_stone_pos not in new_stones and (other_stone_pos == target_pos_after_push):
                                new_stones_after_double_push = new_stones[:]
                                new_stones_after_double_push[jdx] = (other_stone_pos[0] + direction[0], other_stone_pos[1] + direction[1])
                                if is_clear(new_stones_after_double_push[jdx]) and (new_stones_after_double_push.count(new_stones_after_double_push[jdx]) == 1):
                                    additional_state = {'at-player': stone_pos, 'at-stone': new_stones_after_double_push}
                                    if additional_state['at-player'] != new_stones_after_double_push[jdx] and all(additional_state['at-player'] != stone for stone in additional_state['at-stone']):
                                        successor_states.append(additional_state)

    return successor_states
```

### Changes made:
1. Improved handling of pushing stones by ensuring that we check for additional stones after a successful push occurs.
2. The checks ensure that no two stones occupy the same space after moves, which adheres to the game's rules.
3. The structure ensures that all possible configurations resulting from both player movement and stone pushing are considered.

This version should effectively find all valid successors for the given state.

First think step by step why the successor function failed to produce all successors of the state.
Then, fix the successor function.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
The reason why the `successor_states` function is missing certain successors, such as the state `{'at-player': (5, 2), 'at-stone': [(5, 1), (4, 3)]}`, is that the logic for moving the player down into the stone's position and pushing that stone has not been fully explored. Specifically, when pushing a stone, we need to clearly separate the logic that allows the player to push the stones into new, valid positions without prematurely filtering out valid successor states.

In the last implementation, it seems that the logic only checked for single pushes and did not allow for the player to occupy the stone's current position during the push action. This oversight may have led us to overlook some valid moves, particularly those that might occur immediately after a push.

To address this:
1. We must ensure the player can move to the position of a stone before pushing it, and we need to validate the legality of each move.
2. We should properly add the logic to handle the configuration that occurs after a stone is pushed and ensure that any resulting conditions are reflected correctly in the successor states.

Hereâ€™s the corrected code for the `successor_states` function:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        return grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] in [0, 2]

    directions = {
        'up': (-1, 0), 
        'down': (1, 0), 
        'left': (0, -1), 
        'right': (0, 1)
    }
    
    successor_states = []
    player_pos = state['at-player']
    
    for direction in directions.values():
        # Move
        target_pos = (player_pos[0] + direction[0], player_pos[1] + direction[1])
        if is_clear(target_pos):
            new_state = {'at-player': target_pos, 'at-stone': state['at-stone']}
            if new_state['at-player'] not in new_state['at-stone']:
                successor_states.append(new_state)

        # Push
        for idx, stone_pos in enumerate(state['at-stone']):
            if (stone_pos[0] == player_pos[0] + direction[0] and 
                stone_pos[1] == player_pos[1] + direction[1]):
                
                target_pos_after_push = (stone_pos[0] + direction[0], stone_pos[1] + direction[1])
                # Check if the position after the push is clear
                if is_clear(target_pos_after_push):
                    new_stones = state['at-stone'][:]
                    new_stones[idx] = target_pos_after_push
                    
                    # Check for duplicates of stones
                    if (new_stones.count(target_pos_after_push) == 1
                        and all(target_pos_after_push != other_stone for other_stone in new_stones if other_stone != stone_pos)):
                        new_state = {'at-player': stone_pos, 'at-stone': new_stones}
                        if all(new_state['at-player'] != stone for stone in new_state['at-stone']):
                            successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```

### Key Updates
1. **Move Logic**: The player moves into a cell if that cell is clear, and it creates a new state reflecting that movement.
2. **Push Logic**: For each stone, if it's adjacent to the player and can be pushed into a clear space, we create a new state where the stone has been pushed, making sure to check for duplicates in the stone list.
3. **Validation**: Ensure that no overlaps occur among the stones and between the playerâ€™s position and the stones after a move/push.

With this implementation, the successor function should correctly identify all valid states from the given `state`, solving the previous issue with missing successors.

First think step by step why the successor function failed to produce all successors of the state.
Then, fix the successor function.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
The failure of the `successor_states` function to produce all successors is primarily due to not properly checking and implementing the sequence of actions effectively. Specifically, the function doesn't account for the scenario where a player can first move into the position of a stone and then push that stone into an adjacent space. The logic needs to explicitly allow for the player to occupy the stone's position before pushing it, along with the checks to ensure that after pushing, the stones are in valid configurations and that no two stones occupy the same location.

Hereâ€™s a structured plan to fix the `successor_states` function:

1. **Focus on Both Actions**: First, check if the player can move into a clear position and then separately check if the player can push a stone; and if pushing a stone is valid, it should be appended as a potential successor configuration.

2. **State Management**: When pushing a stone, ensure to update the list of stones to reflect the new position, and additionally check for duplication.

3. **Implement Clear Logic**: After pushing a stone, confirm that the resulting state does not conflict with any existing positions of the stones.

With this structured approach in mind, hereâ€™s the revised code:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        return grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] in [0, 2]

    directions = {
        'up': (-1, 0), 
        'down': (1, 0), 
        'left': (0, -1), 
        'right': (0, 1)
    }
    
    successor_states = []
    player_pos = state['at-player']
    
    for direction in directions.values():
        # Move
        target_pos = (player_pos[0] + direction[0], player_pos[1] + direction[1])
        if is_clear(target_pos):
            new_state = {'at-player': target_pos, 'at-stone': state['at-stone']}
            if new_state['at-player'] not in new_state['at-stone']:
                successor_states.append(new_state)

        # Push
        for idx, stone_pos in enumerate(state['at-stone']):
            if (stone_pos[0] == player_pos[0] + direction[0] and 
                stone_pos[1] == player_pos[1] + direction[1]):
                
                target_pos_after_push = (stone_pos[0] + direction[0], stone_pos[1] + direction[1])
                # Check if the position after the push is clear
                if is_clear(target_pos_after_push):
                    new_stones = state['at-stone'][:]
                    new_stones[idx] = target_pos_after_push
                    
                    # Check for duplicates of stones
                    if (new_stones.count(target_pos_after_push) == 1
                        and all(target_pos_after_push != other_stone for other_stone in new_stones if other_stone != stone_pos)):
                        new_state = {'at-player': target_pos_after_push, 'at-stone': new_stones}
                        if all(new_state['at-player'] != stone for stone in new_stones):
                            successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```

### Breakdown of the Key Changes:
1. **Moving the Player**: Now checks if a clear target cell is available adjacent to the player and creates a new state based on that.
2. **Push Mechanics**: If the player can push a stone, it calculates where that stone will go and ensures that the new arrangement of stones does not lead to any duplicates or discrepancies.
3. **Successor Validations**: The final state checks ensure the player does not occupy any stone's position after a push, maintaining valid game rules.

This implementation should effectively generate all valid successor states from the provided input, including the previously missing successor state.

First think step by step why the successor function failed to produce all successors of the state.
Then, fix the successor function.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
The failure to produce all valid successor states from the given state `{'at-player': (5, 3), 'at-stone': [(5, 2), (4, 3)]}` stems from not fully accounting for the situation where the player can move to the stone's position and then push that stone into a clear position. Specifically, the logic does not correctly allow for the player to occupy the stone's current position before pushing it and does not consider all valid push outcomes.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Moving into Stone Position**: The player can move into the position of one of the stones before pushing it. This must be explicitly checked and handled.
2. **Pushing After Moving**: Once the player occupies the stone's position, the player should have the option to push the stone, provided that it will end up in a clear cell.
3. **Resulting State Validations**: After pushing, the function needs to ensure that the new configuration of stones does not include duplicates, ensuring that no two stones end up in the same position.

### Fixing the Function:
The solution involves restructuring the loops and checks to make sure that:
- The player first moves onto the stone.
- Then, if the player is on a stone, the function correctly pushes that stone and checks for all valid successors.

Here's the corrected `successor_states` function:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        return grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] in [0, 2]

    directions = {
        'up': (-1, 0), 
        'down': (1, 0), 
        'left': (0, -1), 
        'right': (0, 1)
    }
    
    successor_states = []
    player_pos = state['at-player']
    
    # First, consider moving to adjacent clear spaces
    for direction in directions.values():
        target_pos = (player_pos[0] + direction[0], player_pos[1] + direction[1])
        if is_clear(target_pos):
            new_state = {'at-player': target_pos, 'at-stone': state['at-stone']}
            if new_state['at-player'] not in new_state['at-stone']:
                successor_states.append(new_state)

    # Now, consider pushing stones
    for idx, stone_pos in enumerate(state['at-stone']):
        for direction in directions.values():
            # Check if the player is adjacent to a stone and can push it
            if (stone_pos[0] == player_pos[0] + direction[0] and 
                stone_pos[1] == player_pos[1] + direction[1]):
                
                target_pos_after_push = (stone_pos[0] + direction[0], stone_pos[1] + direction[1])

                if is_clear(target_pos_after_push):
                    new_stones = state['at-stone'][:]
                    new_stones[idx] = target_pos_after_push

                    # Check for duplicate stones
                    if (new_stones.count(target_pos_after_push) == 1 and 
                        all(target_pos_after_push != other_stone for other_stone in new_stones if other_stone != stone_pos)):
                        
                        # The player moves into the stone's position before pushing
                        new_state = {'at-player': stone_pos, 'at-stone': new_stones}
                        if new_state['at-player'] not in new_state['at-stone'] and all(new_state['at-player'] != stone for stone in new_state['at-stone']):
                            successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Separation of Move and Push Logic**: The function clearly separates the logic for moving and pushing into two distinct loops.
2. **State Creation After Push**: After checking for a valid push, the function creates a new state where the player has moved onto the stone before the push is executed.
3. **Validation for the Resulting State**: Ensures that the new configuration of stones does not result in any duplicates, adhering to the game rules.

This implementation should properly account for all valid successor states, including the previously missing state `{'at-player': (5, 2), 'at-stone': [(5, 1), (4, 3)]}`.

First think step by step why the successor function failed to produce all successors of the state.
Then, fix the successor function.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
The issue with the `successor_states` function failing to produce certain successors, such as `{'at-player': (5, 2), 'at-stone': [(5, 1), (4, 3)]}`, arises from how the playerâ€™s interactions with the stones and their positions are being handled. In particular, the implementation needs to properly account for scenarios where the player can move onto a stone's position before pushing it, and ensure that valid pushing movements are considered afterward.

### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Issue:
1. **Player Can Move to Stoneâ€™s Position**: The player should be able to move into the position of a stone (if it is adjacent) as part of their allowable actions.
2. **Pushing a Stone**: After moving onto a stone, the player should be able to push it to a valid, clear position.
3. **Valid State Management**: After pushing, it is essential to ensure that no two stones occupy the same position and that the playerâ€™s position is valid after any actions.

### Fixing the Function:
We will refine the function to ensure that:
- The action of moving onto an adjacent stone is explicitly acknowledged.
- The logic for pushing must be executed after confirming that the player has moved onto the stone.

Here is the revised version of the `successor_states` function that incorporates these aspects:

```python
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(pos):
        return grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] in [0, 2]

    directions = {
        'up': (-1, 0), 
        'down': (1, 0), 
        'left': (0, -1), 
        'right': (0, 1)
    }
    
    successor_states = []
    player_pos = state['at-player']
    
    # Check moving to a clear space
    for direction in directions.values():
        target_pos = (player_pos[0] + direction[0], player_pos[1] + direction[1])
        if is_clear(target_pos):
            new_state = {'at-player': target_pos, 'at-stone': state['at-stone']}
            if new_state['at-player'] not in new_state['at-stone']:
                successor_states.append(new_state)

    # Check pushing stones
    for idx, stone_pos in enumerate(state['at-stone']):
        for direction in directions.values():
            if (stone_pos[0] == player_pos[0] + direction[0] and 
                stone_pos[1] == player_pos[1] + direction[1]):
                
                target_pos_after_push = (stone_pos[0] + direction[0], stone_pos[1] + direction[1])
                
                # Check if the position after the push is clear
                if is_clear(target_pos_after_push):
                    new_stones = state['at-stone'][:]

### Key Changes in the Code:
1. **Player Moving to Stone's Position**: The movement of the player is clearly defined, allowing the player to step onto the stone's position and then be in a position to push it.
2. **Pushing Logic**: After determining that the player is adjacent to a stone, the function checks if pushing that stone to a clear position is feasible and creates a new state based on that.
3. **State Validation**: Comprehensive checks are included to ensure no two stones are in the same location post-push, and that the player's position is valid concerning the moved stones.

With these updates, the successor function is expected to account for all possible configurations, thereby successfully generating the previously missing successor state.
