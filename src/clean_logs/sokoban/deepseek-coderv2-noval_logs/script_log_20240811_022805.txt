This domain models the classic Sokoban game, where the robot needs to move around and push stones to specific locations while adhering to the constraints defined by the walls in the maze. 
The maze is defined by a grid of values 0,1, and 2, where 2 means it is a goal location for a stone, 1 means the cell is blocked, and either 0 or 2 means that the cell can be occupied. A cell is clear if it can be occupied, but is not occupied by either the player or any stone.

The actions are:

move: This action moves the player in a specified direction. To perform this action, the target location must be clear and adjacent to player's location. Performing this action will result in the player being at the target location and no longer at the starting location, meaning the starting location is now clear, while the target location is now not clear.

push: This action allows the player to push a stone in a specified direction. To perform this action, the player's location, the stone location, and the target location must line up in the same direction, and the target location must be clear. Performing the action results in player being at the stone's initial location and the stone is at the target location. Further, the player's previous location is clear, while the target location is not clear.

Assume that states are defined by a dictionary with keys at-player and at-stone. 
Here is an example of a state
{'at-player': (4, 4), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
Here is an example of the grid:
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

Provide a Python implementation of successor states function, receiving a state and a grid and returning a list of immediate successor states.

Model response:
To implement the successor states function for the Sokoban game, we need to consider both the `move` and `push` actions. The function will take the current state and the grid as inputs and return a list of possible successor states based on the defined actions.

Here's the Python implementation:

python
```
def successor_states(state, grid):
    def is_clear(x, y):
        return grid[x][y] in [0, 2] and (x, y) not in state['at-stone'] and (x, y) != state['at-player']

    def move(direction):
        dx, dy = direction
        px, py = state['at-player']
        new_px, new_py = px + dx, py + dy
        if is_clear(new_px, new_py):
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state['at-player'] = (new_px, new_py)
            return new_state
        return None

    def push(direction):
        dx, dy = direction
        px, py = state['at-player']
        for sx, sy in state['at-stone']:
            if px + dx == sx and py + dy == sy:
                new_sx, new_sy = sx + dx, sy + dy
                if is_clear(new_sx, new_sy):
                    new_state = state.copy()
                    new_state['at-player'] = (sx, sy)
                    new_state['at-stone'] = [(new_sx, new_sy) if (x, y) == (sx, sy) else (x, y) for x, y in new_state['at-stone']]
                    return new_state
        return None

    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # Right, Down, Left, Up
    successors = []

    for direction in directions:
        new_state_move = move(direction)
        if new_state_move:
            successors.append(new_state_move)
        new_state_push = push(direction)
        if new_state_push:
            successors.append(new_state_push)

    return successors

# Example usage:
state = {'at-player': (4, 4), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
grid = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]

successors = successor_states(state, grid)
for s in successors:
    print(s)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Helper Functions**:
   - `is_clear(x, y)`: Checks if a cell is clear (either 0 or 2 and not occupied by the player or a stone).
   - `move(direction)`: Attempts to move the player in the specified direction.
   - `push(direction)`: Attempts to push a stone in the specified direction.

2. **Directions**:
   - The `directions` list contains the possible movement directions: right, down, left, and up.

3. **Successor States**:
   - For each direction, the function tries to perform both a `move` and a `push` action.
   - If a valid new state is generated, it is added to the `successors` list.

4. **Example Usage**:
   - The example demonstrates how to use the `successor_states` function with a given state and grid, and prints the resulting successor states.

This implementation ensures that all possible valid moves and pushes are considered, generating the immediate successor states for the given state and grid

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state for a given goal configuration. Assume that the goal configuration is provided by the 2-dimensional array as before. The function should receive a state and the 2-dimensional array and return True if the state is a goal state and False otherwise.

Model response:
python
```
def is_goal_state(state, grid):
    for stone in state['at-stone']:
        if grid[stone[0]][stone[1]] != 2:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage:
state = {'at-player': (4, 4), 'at-stone': [(2, 2), (3, 3)]}
grid = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]

print(is_goal_state(state, grid))  # Output: False
