The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Model response:
To define successor states, we need to consider all possible operations (+, -, *, /) between each pair of numbers in the state. Here's the step-by-step process:
Choose two numbers from the state (e.g., 6 and 6).
Apply each operation to the chosen numbers:
Addition: 6 + 6 = 12
Subtraction: 6 - 6 = 0, 6 - 6 = 0 (since order doesn't matter)
Multiplication: 6 * 6 = 36
Division: 6 / 6 = 1, 6 / 6 = 1 (since order doesn't matter)
Replace the chosen numbers in the state with the result of each operation, creating a new state:
[12, 2, 1]
[0, 2, 1]
[36, 2, 1]
[1, 2, 1]
Repeat steps 1-3 for all possible pairs of numbers in the state.
Here's the Python function to generate successor states:
Python
```
def get_successor_states(state):
    successor_states = []
    for i in range(len(state)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(state)):
            num1, num2 = state[i], state[j]
            new_states = [
                [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k not in (i, j)] + [num1 + num2],
                [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k not in (i, j)] + [num1 - num2],
                [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k not in (i, j)] + [num2 - num1],
                [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k not in (i, j)] + [num1 * num2],
                [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k not in (i, j)] + [num1 / num2] if num2 != 0 else [],
                [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k not in (i, j)] + [num2 / num1] if num1 != 0 else []
            ]
            successor_states.extend(new_states)
    return successor_states
```
This function takes a state as input and returns a list of successor states. Note that it avoids division by zero and skips duplicate operations (e.g., 6 - 6 and 6 - 6)

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. 
Example goal state: [24]
Example non-goal state: [24,1]

Model response:
Here is the Python code that tests whether a state is a goal state:
Python
```
def is_goal_state(state):
    return len(state) == 1 and state[0] == 24
```
This function checks if the state has only one element and that element is 24, making it a goal state
