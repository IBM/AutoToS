The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Model response:
Successor States in the 24 Game
Definition
Given a state in the 24 Game, a successor state is one that results from applying a mathematical operation (+, -, *, /) to two numbers in the state, reducing the list of numbers by one.
Step-by-Step Process
Choose Two Numbers: Select two distinct numbers from the current state.
Apply Operations: For each pair of chosen numbers, apply all four mathematical operations (+, -, *, /) to generate new numbers.
Create Successor States: For each new number generated, create a new state by replacing the two chosen numbers with the new number, ensuring the new state has one less number than the original state.
Handle Division by Zero: Ignore division operations that would result in division by zero.
Python Function to Generate Successor States
```Python
def get_successor_states(state):
    """
    Generate all possible successor states for a given state in the 24 Game.

    Parameters:
    state (list): A list of numbers representing the current state.

    Returns:
    list: A list of lists, where each sublist is a successor state.
    """
    successor_states = []

    # Iterate over all pairs of distinct numbers in the state
    for i in range(len(state)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(state)):
            # Extract the two chosen numbers
            num1, num2 = state[i], state[j]

            # Generate new numbers by applying mathematical operations
            new_numbers = [
                num1 + num2,
                num1 - num2,
                num2 - num1,
                num1 * num2,
            ]
            # Handle division, avoiding division by zero
            if num2 != 0:
                new_numbers.append(num1 / num2)
            if num1 != 0:
                new_numbers.append(num2 / num1)

            # Create successor states for each new number
            for new_num in new_numbers:
                successor_state = state[:i] + state[i + 1:j] + state[j + 1:] + [new_num]
                successor_states.append(successor_state)

    return successor_states
```

```
# Example usage
initial_state = [6, 6, 2, 1]
successors = get_successor_states(initial_state)
for state in successors:
    print(state)
```
This function generates all possible successor states by applying mathematical operations to all pairs of distinct numbers in the input state, handling division by zero appropriately. The result is a comprehensive list of next possible states in the 24 Game, useful for exploring the game tree or implementing a solution strategy.

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. 
Example goal state: [24]
Example non-goal state: [24,1]

Model response:
Python Function to Check if a State is a Goal State
```Python
def is_goal_state(state):
    """
    Check if a given state is a goal state in the 24 Game.

    A goal state is defined as a state containing only the number 24.

    Parameters:
    state (list): A list of numbers representing the current state.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the state is a goal state, False otherwise.
    """
    return state == [24]
```    
Example Usage:
```Python
# Test a goal state
print(is_goal_state([24]))  # Output: True

# Test a non-goal state
print(is_goal_state([24, 1]))  # Output: False
