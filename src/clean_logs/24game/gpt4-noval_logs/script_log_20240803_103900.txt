The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Model response:
To generate the successor states for a given state in the 24 Game, we need to consider all possible pairs of numbers, perform all possible operations on those pairs, and generate the resulting new states by replacing the pair with the result of the operation. Here's the Python function to accomplish this:

```python
from itertools import combinations
from operator import add, sub, mul, truediv

def generate_successor_states(state):
    def apply_operation(a, b, op):
        if op == add:
            return a + b
        elif op == sub:
            return a - b
        elif op == mul:
            return a * b
        elif op == truediv:
            if b != 0:
                return a / b
        return None

    def successor_states(nums):
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return []
        operations = [add, sub, mul, truediv]
        successors = []
        for (i, j) in combinations(range(len(nums)), 2):
            for op in operations:
                result = apply_operation(nums[i], nums[j], op)
                if result is not None:
                    new_nums = [nums[k] for k in range(len(nums)) if k != i and k != j]
                    new_nums.append(result)
                    successors.append(new_nums)
        return successors

    return successor_states(state)
```

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. 
Example goal state: [24]
Example non-goal state: [24,1]

Model response:
```python
def is_goal_state(state):
    return state == [24]
```

AutoToS prompt:
Successor function when run on the state [1, 1, 4, 6] failed to produce all successors.
Missing successors are: [[1, 1, 2], [1, 3, 6], [1, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1.5]]
First think step by step why the successor function failed to produce all successors of the state.
Then, fix the successor function.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
To determine why the successor function failed to produce all successors, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Combining numbers**: For every pair of numbers in the state, the function should generate a new state by applying each of the four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

2. **Adding results to new states**: The results of these operations should be inserted back into the list of numbers, and the two original numbers in the pair should be removed from the list.

3. **Handling all pairs and operations**: Ensure that all valid combinations of operations and pairs are considered, and that results are correctly appended without any loss of potential states.

Now let's fix the function to ensure it covers all cases correctly. Specifically, the `apply_operation` function should handle each pair adequately. Additionally, all resulting new states should be generated correctly.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
from itertools import combinations
from operator import add, sub, mul, truediv

def generate_successor_states(state):
    def apply_operation(a, b, op):
        if op == add:
            return a + b
        elif op == sub:
            return a - b
        elif op == mul:
            return a * b
        elif op == truediv:
            if b != 0:
                return a / b
        return None

    def successor_states(nums):
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return []
        operations = [add, sub, mul, truediv]
        successors = []
        for (i, j) in combinations(range(len(nums)), 2):
            for op in operations:
                result = apply_operation(nums[i], nums[j], op)
                if result is not None:
                    new_nums = [nums[k] for k in range(len(nums)) if k != i and k != j]
                    new_nums.append(result)
                    successors.append(new_nums)

                # Apply the operation in reverse order for non-commutative operations
                result = apply_operation(nums[j], nums[i], op)
                if result is not None and op in [sub, truediv]: # Only sub and truediv need reverse check
                    new_nums = [nums[k] for k in range(len(nums)) if k != i and k != j]
                    new_nums.append(result)
                    successors.append(new_nums)

        return successors

    return successor_states(state)
```
