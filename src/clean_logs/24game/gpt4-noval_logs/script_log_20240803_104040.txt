The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Model response:
To generate successor states for the given numbers, we need to perform all possible arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) between any two numbers in the list. The result of each operation forms a new number, and we subtract the two original numbers from the list and add the new result. We continue doing this until we have fewer than two numbers left. Below is the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

```python
import itertools

def successor_states(numbers):
    def generate_successors(nums):
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return []
        
        successors = []
        for i, j in itertools.combinations(range(len(nums)), 2):
            remaining_nums = [nums[k] for k in range(len(nums)) if k != i and k != j]
            x, y = nums[i], nums[j]

            # Addition
            successors.append(remaining_nums + [x + y])
            # Subtraction (two ways)
            successors.append(remaining_nums + [x - y])
            successors.append(remaining_nums + [y - x])
            # Multiplication
            successors.append(remaining_nums + [x * y])
            # Division (two ways, if not dividing by zero)
            if y != 0:
                successors.append(remaining_nums + [x / y])
            if x != 0:
                successors.append(remaining_nums + [y / x])

        return successors

    return generate_successors(numbers)
```

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. 
Example goal state: [24]
Example non-goal state: [24,1]

Model response:
```python
def is_goal_state(state):
    return len(state) == 1 and state[0] == 24
