The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Model response:
To get successor states, we need to consider all possible operations between any pair of numbers from the list and generate new states by reducing the list size by one each time. Here is the Python function to generate these successor states:

```python
import itertools
import operator

def get_successor_states(state):
    def apply_operations(x, y):
        operations = [operator.add, operator.sub, operator.mul]
        if y != 0:
            operations.append(operator.truediv)
        
        return [op(x, y) for op in operations]
    
    successor_states = []

    for (i, j) in itertools.combinations(range(len(state)), 2):
        for result in apply_operations(state[i], state[j]):
            new_state = [result] + [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k != i and k != j]
            successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. 
Example goal state: [24]
Example non-goal state: [24,1]

Model response:
```python
def is_goal_state(state):
    return state == [24]
```

Successor Iteration 1

AutoToS prompt:
Successor function when run on the state [1, 1, 4, 6] failed to produce all successors.
Missing successors are: [[1, 1, 2], [1, 3, 6], [1, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1.5]]
First think step by step why the successor function failed to produce all successors of the state.
Then, fix the successor function.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
To identify why the function may have missed some successor states, consider the following:

1. **Symmetry in Operations**: Operations like addition and multiplication are commutative (i.e., 1 + 3 is the same as 3 + 1), while subtraction and division are not. If we treat each unique pair only once, we may miss some combinations.
2. **Operation Order**: We should ensure we apply all the operations in both possible orders (e.g., `x op y` and `y op x` for all `x, y` pairs).

Let's update the code to consider all pairs and operations in both orders:

```python
import itertools
import operator

def get_successor_states(state):
    def apply_operations(x, y):
        operations = [operator.add, operator.sub, operator.mul]
        if y != 0:
            operations.append(operator.truediv)
        return [op(x, y) for op in operations] + [op(y, x) for op in operations if op in (operator.sub, operator.truediv)]

    successor_states = []

    for (i, j) in itertools.combinations(range(len(state)), 2):
        for result in apply_operations(state[i], state[j]):
            new_state = [result] + [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k != i and k != j]
            successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```
Successor Iteration 2

AutoToS prompt:
The following exception was produced when testing the successor function: 
  File "<string>", line 9, in <listcomp>

division by zero. Please fix this exception in the successor function.
Model response:
To handle the division by zero exception, we need to make sure we skip division operations when the denominator (y) is zero. Let's update the code accordingly:

```python
import itertools
import operator

def get_successor_states(state):
    def apply_operations(x, y):
        operations = [operator.add, operator.sub, operator.mul]
        results = []
        for op in operations:
            results.append(op(x, y))
            results.append(op(y, x))
        if y != 0:
            results.append(operator.truediv(x, y))
        if x != 0:
            results.append(operator.truediv(y, x))
        return results

    successor_states = []

    for (i, j) in itertools.combinations(range(len(state)), 2):
        for result in apply_operations(state[i], state[j]):
            new_state = [result] + [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k != i and k != j]
            successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```
