The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Model response:
To generate successor states for the 24 Game, we can follow these steps:

1. Select two numbers from the list.
2. Apply one of the four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to these two numbers.
3. Replace the two selected numbers with the result of the operation, forming a new list.
4. Repeat the process for every possible combination and operation.

Here's the function to generate the successor states:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def generate_successor_states(state):
    def apply_operations(a, b):
        results = set()
        results.add(a + b)
        results.add(a - b)
        results.add(b - a)
        results.add(a * b)
        if b != 0:
            results.add(a / b)
        if a != 0:
            results.add(b / a)
        return results

    successor_states = []
    for i, j in combinations(range(len(state)), 2):
        for result in apply_operations(state[i], state[j]):
            new_state = [result] + [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k != i and k != j]
            successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. 
Example goal state: [24]
Example non-goal state: [24,1]

Model response:
```python
def is_goal_state(state):
    return len(state) == 1 and state[0] == 24
```
