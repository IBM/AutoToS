The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Successor Iteration 4

AutoToS prompt:
Successor function when run on the state [1, 1, 4, 6] failed to produce all successors.
Missing successors are: [[1, 1, 10], [0.6666666666666666, 1, 1], [1, 4, 7], [-2, 1, 1], [-5, 1, 4], [1, 4, 6], [1, 1, 2], [1, 5, 6], [0.25, 1, 6], [-3, 1, 6], [0, 4, 6], [0.16666666666666666, 1, 4], [1, 1, 24], [1, 3, 6], [2, 4, 6], [1, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1.5]]
First think step by step why the successor function failed to produce all successors of the state.
Then, fix the successor function.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
The successor function failed to produce all successors of the state [1, 1, 4, 6] likely because it only considered all pairs of numbers in the list for operations and didn't account for every potential combination of results. Additionally, when performing operations, it's crucial to ensure that we exhaustively consider all possible pairs and maintain the order of numbers correctly.

To fix this, let's iterate over all possible pairs more thoroughly and ensure we correctly handle all outcomes by recombining numbers appropriately after each operation. Hereâ€™s the corrected successor function:

```python
def successor_states(state):
    from itertools import permutations
    from operator import add, sub, mul, truediv

    operations = [add, sub, mul, truediv]
    
    def valid_division(a, b):
        return b != 0

    successors = set()
    
    for nums in permutations(state):
        for i in range(len(nums)):  # First number index
            for j in range(len(nums)):  # Second number index
                if i == j:
                    continue
                
                for op in operations:
                    if op == truediv and not valid_division(nums[i], nums[j]):
                        continue

                    if op in (add, sub):
                        result = op(nums[i], nums[j])
                        new_nums = [nums[k] for k in range(len(nums)) if k != i and k != j] + [result]
                        successors.add(tuple(new_nums))
                        
                    elif op == mul:
                        result = op(nums[i], nums[j])
                        new_nums = [nums[k] for k in range(len(nums)) if k != i and k != j] + [result]
                        successors.add(tuple(new_nums))
                        
                    elif op == truediv:
                        if valid_division(nums[i], nums[j]):
                            result = op(nums[i], nums[j])
                            new_nums = [nums[k] for k in range(len(nums)) if k != i and k != j] + [result]
                            successors.add(tuple(new_nums))
    
    return [list(state) for state in successors]
``` 

In this implementation:
1. We perform operations on all pairs of indices by ensuring we check every combination of indices.
2. After performing an operation, we build a new list excluding the two numbers used and adding the result, which allows us to maintain the correct size of the list.
3. The permutations ensure different orders are considered so that all potential results from the numbers in any order are captured.
