The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Model response:
To define successor states for the 24 Game, we need to consider all possible ways to combine two numbers from the list using the allowed operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Each combination will result in a new list of numbers, which represents a successor state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to generate successor states:

Select two numbers from the list: For a list of four numbers, there are 
(
4
2
)
=
6
( 
2
4
â€‹
 )=6 ways to choose two numbers.

Apply the operations: For each pair of numbers, apply addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to get a new number.

Form the new list: Replace the two chosen numbers with the result of the operation, leaving the other two numbers unchanged. This forms a new list of three numbers.

Repeat for all pairs and operations: Perform the above steps for all pairs of numbers and for all four operations.

Here is the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state:

python
Copy code
```
from itertools import combinations

def successor_states(state):
    successors = []
    for (a, b) in combinations(state, 2):
        remaining = list(state)
        remaining.remove(a)
        remaining.remove(b)
        
        # Addition
        successors.append(remaining + [a + b])
        
        # Subtraction (both ways)
        successors.append(remaining + [a - b])
        successors.append(remaining + [b - a])
        
        # Multiplication
        successors.append(remaining + [a * b])
        
        # Division (both ways, avoiding division by zero)
        if b != 0:
            successors.append(remaining + [a / b])
        if a != 0:
            successors.append(remaining + [b / a])
    
    return successors

# Example usage:
initial_state = [6, 6, 2, 1]
print(successor_states(initial_state))
```
This function generates all possible successor states by combining pairs of numbers with each of the four operations, ensuring that each operation is applied correctly and avoiding division by zero. The resulting list of successor states can be used to explore further combinations in the search for the number 24

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. 
Example goal state: [24]
Example non-goal state: [24,1]

Model response:
python

def is_goal_state(state):
    return state == [24]

# Example usage:
goal_state = [24]
non_goal_state = [24, 1]

print(is_goal_state(non_goal_state))   # Output: False
