The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Model response:
To define successor states for the 24 Game, we need to consider all possible ways to combine two numbers from the list using the allowed operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Each combination will result in a new list of numbers, which represents a successor state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to generate successor states:

1. **Select two distinct numbers from the list**: For a list of four numbers, there are 6 possible pairs.
2. **Apply each operation to the selected pair**: For each pair, apply addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to get a new number.
3. **Form the new list**: Replace the selected pair with the new number, resulting in a list of three numbers.

For example, given the initial state `[6, 6, 2, 1]`:
- Select the pair `(6, 6)`:
  - Addition: `6 + 6 = 12` -> New list: `[12, 2, 1]`
  - Subtraction: `6 - 6 = 0` -> New list: `[0, 2, 1]`
  - Multiplication: `6 * 6 = 36` -> New list: `[36, 2, 1]`
  - Division: `6 / 6 = 1` -> New list: `[1, 2, 1]` (Note: Division by zero is not allowed)

Repeat this process for all pairs and operations to generate all possible successor states.

Here is the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state:

python
```
def successor_states(state):
    successors = []
    operations = [lambda x, y: x + y, lambda x, y: x - y, lambda x, y: x * y, lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else None]
    n = len(state)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                for op in operations:
                    new_value = op(state[i], state[j])
                    if new_value is not None:
                        new_state = [state[k] for k in range(n) if k != i and k != j] + [new_value]
                        successors.append(new_state)
    
    return successors

# Example usage:
initial_state = [6, 6, 2, 1]
print(successor_states(initial_state))
```

This function iterates over all pairs of numbers in the input state, applies each operation, and constructs the new list of numbers (successor state) by replacing the selected pair with the result of the operation. The resulting list of successor states is returned

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. 
Example goal state: [24]
Example non-goal state: [24,1]

Model response:
python
```
def is_goal_state(state):
    return state == [24]

# Example usage:
goal_state = [24]
non_goal_state = [24, 1]

print(is_goal_state(goal_state))       # Output: True
print(is_goal_state(non_goal_state))    # Output: False
