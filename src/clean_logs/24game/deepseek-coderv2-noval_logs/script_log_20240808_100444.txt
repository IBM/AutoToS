The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Model response:
To define successor states for the 24 Game, we need to consider all possible ways to combine two numbers from the list using the allowed operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Each combination will result in a new list of numbers, which represents a successor state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to generate successor states:

1. **Select Two Numbers**: Choose any two numbers from the list.
2. **Apply Operations**: Apply each of the four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to the selected numbers.
3. **Generate New List**: Replace the two selected numbers with the result of the operation, forming a new list of numbers.
4. **Repeat**: Repeat the process for all possible pairs of numbers and all operations.

For example, given the initial state `[6, 6, 2, 1]`:
- Select `6` and `6`, apply addition to get `12`, new list: `[12, 2, 1]`
- Select `6` and `6`, apply subtraction to get `0`, new list: `[0, 2, 1]`
- Select `6` and `6`, apply multiplication to get `36`, new list: `[36, 2, 1]`
- Select `6` and `6`, apply division to get `1`, new list: `[1, 2, 1]`
- Repeat for other pairs and operations...

Here is the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state:

python
```
def successor_states(state):
    successors = []
    n = len(state)
    
    # Iterate over all pairs of numbers in the state
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            a, b = state[i], state[j]
            
            # Generate new states by applying operations
            new_state_add = state[:i] + state[i+1:j] + state[j+1:] + [a + b]
            new_state_sub1 = state[:i] + state[i+1:j] + state[j+1:] + [a - b]
            new_state_sub2 = state[:i] + state[i+1:j] + state[j+1:] + [b - a]
            new_state_mul = state[:i] + state[i+1:j] + state[j+1:] + [a * b]
            
            # Avoid division by zero
            if b != 0:
                new_state_div1 = state[:i] + state[i+1:j] + state[j+1:] + [a / b]
            else:
                new_state_div1 = None
            
            if a != 0:
                new_state_div2 = state[:i] + state[i+1:j] + state[j+1:] + [b / a]
            else:
                new_state_div2 = None
            
            # Add valid new states to the list of successors
            if new_state_add not in successors:
                successors.append(new_state_add)
            if new_state_sub1 not in successors:
                successors.append(new_state_sub1)
            if new_state_sub2 not in successors:
                successors.append(new_state_sub2)
            if new_state_mul not in successors:
                successors.append(new_state_mul)
            if new_state_div1 is not None and new_state_div1 not in successors:
                successors.append(new_state_div1)
            if new_state_div2 is not None and new_state_div2 not in successors:
                successors.append(new_state_div2)
    
    return successors

# Example usage:
initial_state = [6, 6, 2, 1]
print(successor_states(initial_state))
```

This function generates all possible successor states by combining pairs of numbers with the four basic arithmetic operations. Note that it avoids division by zero and ensures that each new state is unique by checking if it is already in the list of successors
