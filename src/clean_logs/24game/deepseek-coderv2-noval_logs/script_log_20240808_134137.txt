The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Model response:
To define successor states for the 24 Game, we need to consider all possible ways to combine two numbers from the list using the allowed operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Each combination will result in a new list of numbers, which represents a successor state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to generate successor states:

1. **Select two numbers from the list**: For a list of four numbers, there are \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) ways to choose two numbers.
2. **Apply the operations**: For each pair of numbers, apply addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to get a new number.
3. **Form the new list**: Replace the two chosen numbers with the result of the operation, leaving the other two numbers unchanged. This forms a new list of three numbers.
4. **Repeat for all pairs and operations**: Repeat the process for all pairs of numbers and for all four operations.

Here is the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state:

python
```
def successor_states(state):
    successors = []
    operations = [
        lambda x, y: x + y,
        lambda x, y: x - y,
        lambda x, y: y - x,
        lambda x, y: x * y,
        lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else None,
        lambda x, y: y / x if x != 0 else None
    ]
    
    for i in range(len(state)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(state)):
            for op in operations:
                new_value = op(state[i], state[j])
                if new_value is not None:
                    new_state = [new_value] + [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k != i and k != j]
                    successors.append(new_state)
    
    return successors

# Example usage:
initial_state = [6, 6, 2, 1]
print(successor_states(initial_state))
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Operations List**: We define a list of lambda functions representing the allowed operations. Each lambda function takes two arguments and returns the result of the operation.
2. **Nested Loops**: We use nested loops to iterate over all pairs of numbers in the state list.
3. **Apply Operations**: For each pair, we apply all operations and check if the result is valid (i.e., not `None` for division by zero).
4. **Form New State**: We create a new list by replacing the two chosen numbers with the result of the operation and keeping the other numbers unchanged.
5. **Append to Successors**: We append each valid new state to the list of successor states.

This function will generate all possible successor states for a given initial state in the 24 Game

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. 
Example goal state: [24]
Example non-goal state: [24,1]

Model response:
python
```
def is_goal_state(state):
    return state == [24]

# Example usage:
goal_state = [24]
non_goal_state = [24, 1]

print(is_goal_state(goal_state))       # Output: True
print(is_goal_state(non_goal_state))    # Output: False
