The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Successor Iteration 9

AutoToS prompt:
Successor function when run on the state [1, 4, 6] failed to produce all successors.
Missing successors are: [[4, 6]]
First think step by step why the successor function failed to produce all successors of the state.
Then, fix the successor function.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
The issue with the existing successor function is that it only considers pairs of numbers for operations and then adds the result with the remaining numbers. However, it does not explore all combinations of the remaining numbers after getting a result from a pair. To generate complete successor states, we need to ensure that after an operation is performed, the result is combined with all possible combinations of the remaining numbers, including further operations.

This means:
1. After calculating a result from two selected numbers, we should consider this result along with the others for further calculations, using the available operations again.
2. Instead of restricting to just pairing without recursion, we should generate all possible combinations through additional recursive steps.

Here’s how to implement this:

```python
def get_successor_states(state):
    from itertools import permutations
    from operator import add, sub, mul, truediv

    def valid_expression(a, b, op):
        if op == truediv and b == 0:
            return None
        return op(a, b)

    def generate_expressions(n1, n2):
        return [
            (valid_expression(n1, n2, add), '+'),
            (valid_expression(n1, n2, sub), '-'),
            (valid_expression(n1, n2, mul), '*'),
            (valid_expression(n1, n2, truediv), '/')
        ]

    successor_states = set()

    def generate_successors(current_state):
        # Add current state if it has valid length
        if len(current_state) == 1:
            successor_states.add(tuple(current_state))
        
        for i in range(len(current_state)):
            for j in range(len(current_state)):
                if i != j:
                    n1, n2 = current_state[i], current_state[j]
                    remaining = [current_state[k] for k in range(len(current_state)) if k != i and k != j]
                    expressions = generate_expressions(n1, n2)

                    for result, _ in expressions:
                        if result is not None:
                            new_numbers = [result] + remaining
                            generate_successors(new_numbers)

    generate_successors(state)
    return [list(state) for state in successor_states]
``` 

In this revised function:
- I introduced a recursive `generate_successors` function to keep generating successors by carrying forward the newly created numbers after each operation.
- This handles multiple generations of outcomes by applying the operations on the intermediate results recursively until we are left with a single number or valid states.

Maximum iterations reached for completeness test. Process stopped.
