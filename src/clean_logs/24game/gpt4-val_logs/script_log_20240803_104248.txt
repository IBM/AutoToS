The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Model response:
To generate the successor states for a given state (list of numbers), we need to consider all possible ways to combine any two numbers using the four arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and replace them with the result of the operation. We then repeat this process recursively for the remaining states.

Here is the function to generate the successor states for an input state:

```python
from itertools import permutations
from operator import add, sub, mul, truediv

def generate_successor_states(state):
    def valid_division(a, b):
        return b != 0 and a % b == 0
    
    def apply_operations(a, b):
        results = [add(a, b), sub(a, b), sub(b, a), mul(a, b)]
        if b != 0:
            results.append(a / b)
        if a != 0:
            results.append(b / a)
        return results

    def generate_new_states(state):
        n = len(state)
        new_states = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                for op_result in apply_operations(state[i], state[j]):
                    new_state = [op_result] + [state[k] for k in range(n) if k != i and k != j]
                    if new_state not in new_states:
                        new_states.append(new_state)
        return new_states
    
    if len(state) == 1:
        return []
    else:
        return generate_new_states(state)
```

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. 
Example goal state: [24]
Example non-goal state: [24,1]

Model response:
```python
def is_goal_state(state):
    return len(state) == 1 and state[0] == 24
