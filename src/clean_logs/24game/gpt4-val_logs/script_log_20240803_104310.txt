The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Model response:
To generate a list of successor states for the given state, you need to:
1. Take two numbers from the list and apply one of the four operations (+, -, *, /).
2. Generate a new list that includes the result of the operation and the remaining numbers.
3. Repeat this process for every unique pair of numbers and every operation, making sure to handle division by zero and both a-b and b-a cases for subtraction.

Here is the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state:

```python
from itertools import permutations

def generate_successor_states(state):
    def valid_operations(a, b):
        operations = set()
        operations.add(a + b)
        operations.add(a - b)
        operations.add(b - a)
        operations.add(a * b)
        if b != 0:
            operations.add(a / b)
        if a != 0:
            operations.add(b / a)
        return operations

    successor_states = set()
    for (i, j) in permutations(range(len(state)), 2):
        remaining_numbers = [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k != i and k != j]
        for result in valid_operations(state[i], state[j]):
            new_state = [result] + remaining_numbers
            if len(new_state) > 1:
                new_state_tuple = tuple(sorted(new_state))
                successor_states.add(new_state_tuple)
            else:
                successor_states.add(tuple(new_state))

    return [list(state) for state in successor_states]

```

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. 
Example goal state: [24]
Example non-goal state: [24,1]

Model response:
```python
def is_goal_state(state):
    return len(state) == 1 and state[0] == 24
