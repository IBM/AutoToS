The 24 Game is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The game is played with a list of four numbers, and the player must use all four numbers exactly once, using any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to arrive at the number 24. If a state is defined by a list of numbers (4 or less), how are successor states defined? Please think step by step. Then, provide only the Python function that returns a list of successor states for an input state.

Here is an example of an initial state:
[6, 6, 2, 1]

Model response:
To generate the successor states of a given list of numbers in the 24 Game, you need to perform each possible arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on each pair of numbers, and include all possible combinations of results along with the remaining numbers.

Here's the Python function to generate all successor states for a given state:

```python
def generate_successor_states(state):
    from itertools import combinations

    def apply_operations(a, b):
        operations = [
            lambda x, y: x + y,
            lambda x, y: x - y,
            lambda x, y: y - x,
            lambda x, y: x * y,
            lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else None,
            lambda x, y: y / x if x != 0 else None,
        ]
        results = []
        for operation in operations:
            result = operation(a, b)
            if result is not None and (result >= 0 or result.is_integer()):
                results.append(result)
        return results

    successors = []

    for (i, j) in combinations(range(len(state)), 2):
        remaining = [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k != i and k != j]
        for result in apply_operations(state[i], state[j]):
            successors.append(remaining + [result])

    return successors
```

AutoToS prompt:

Provide only the python code that tests whether a state is a goal state. 
Example goal state: [24]
Example non-goal state: [24,1]

Model response:
```python
def is_goal_state(state):
    return len(state) == 1 and state[0] == 24
```

AutoToS prompt:
The following exception was produced when testing the successor function: 
  File "<string>", line 16, in apply_operations

'int' object has no attribute 'is_integer'. Please fix this exception in the successor function.
Model response:
Here's the revised function with the correction for the error:

```python
def generate_successor_states(state):
    from itertools import combinations

    def apply_operations(a, b):
        operations = [
            lambda x, y: x + y,
            lambda x, y: x - y,
            lambda x, y: y - x,
            lambda x, y: x * y,
            lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else None,
            lambda x, y: y / x if x != 0 else None,
        ]
        results = []
        for operation in operations:
            result = operation(a, b)
            if result is not None and (isinstance(result, int) or result.is_integer()):
                results.append(result)
        return results

    successors = []

    for (i, j) in combinations(range(len(state)), 2):
        remaining = [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k != i and k != j]
        for result in apply_operations(state[i], state[j]):
            successors.append(remaining + [result])

    return successors
```

AutoToS prompt:
Successor function when run on the state [1, 1, 4, 6] failed to produce all successors.
Missing successors are: [[0.6666666666666666, 1, 1], [0.25, 1, 6], [0.16666666666666666, 1, 4], [1, 1, 1.5]]
First think step by step why the successor function failed to produce all successors of the state.
Then, fix the successor function.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Model response:
The issue with the initial implementation is that it excludes some valid results due to the conditions applied while filtering the results. Letâ€™s go through a step-by-step troubleshooting:

1. **Filter condition (if result is not None and ...)**
   - We're improperly filtering out some results, particularly floating-point division results that could be valid.

2. **Combination of operations**
   - Each pair of results, alongside the remaining numbers, should produce all possible valid combinations.

Here's the revised function to generate all successor states for a given state:

```python
def generate_successor_states(state):
    from itertools import combinations

    def apply_operations(a, b):
        operations = [
            lambda x, y: x + y,
            lambda x, y: x - y,
            lambda x, y: y - x,
            lambda x, y: x * y,
            lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else None,
            lambda x, y: y / x if x != 0 else None,
        ]
        results = []
        for operation in operations:
            result = operation(a, b)
            if result is not None:
                results.append(result)
        return results

    successors = []

    for (i, j) in combinations(range(len(state)), 2):
        remaining = [state[k] for k in range(len(state)) if k != i and k != j]
        for result in apply_operations(state[i], state[j]):
            successors.append(remaining + [result])

    return successors
```
