The task is a 5x5 mini crosswords. A state is a 2D array representing the current puzzle state, where the initial grid is all "None". Note that some of the possible answers are not exactly 5 character long. Given an input of possible answers to horizontal clues and vertical clues, how is the successor state function defined? Please first think step by step. Then provide the successor state function in Python code. 

The possible clues for each row and each column are given separately. Here is an example of possible horizontal and vertical clues:

horizontal_answers = [
        ["tasks", "goals", "plans", "agend", "chores", "works", "deeds", "items", "lists", "brief"],
        ["motor", "power", "drive", "diesel", "steam", "pumps", "crank", "gears", "turbn", "motor"],
        ["grand", "artsy", "showy", "ornate", "fancy", "vain", "proud", "vogue", "swank", "luxus"], 
        ["venue", "salle", "forum", "atria", "lobby", "parls", "court", "malls", "mall", "lobby"], 
        ["jeer", "scoff", "sleer", "deris", "sneer", "scorn", "derid", "gibes", "gibed", "flout"] 
]
vertical_answers = [
        ["amass", "stack", "hoard", "pile", "store", "heaps", "massy", "gathe", "lumps", "mound"],
        ["nilga", "goral", "eland", "lepus", "gazal", "kudu", "oryx", "gnu", "imps", "carb"],
        ["scheme", "design", "ettle", "nettle", "sting", "wiles", "plans", "ideas", "plots", "cocks"], 
        ["spout", "nosle", "snout", "mouth", "nostr", "ports", "inlet", "vents", "outlt", "beaks"], 
        ["drier", "arid", "sere", "parch", "dryer", "wring", "drear", "sear", "pall", "lack"]
]

where horizontal_answers is a list where element i is a list of possible answers to clue in row i, and vertical_answers is a list where element i is a list of possible answers to clue in column i.

Model response:
To generate successors for a 5x5 mini crossword puzzle state, you need to take each possible answer for a horizontal or vertical clue and fill the corresponding row or column accordingly. The task involves generating a new state where one horizontal or one vertical clue answer is applied at a time.

Here's how you can derive the successor states step by step:

1. **Initialization**: Create a 2D array that represents the puzzle grid. Initially, it is filled with `None`.

2. **Applying Horizontal Clue Answers**:
   - For each row, iterate over the list of possible answers.
   - For each answer in the list, generate a new state by placing the answer in the current row.

3. **Applying Vertical Clue Answers**:
   - For each column, iterate over the list of possible answers.
   - For each answer in the list, generate a new state by placing the answer in the current column.

4. **Combining Horizontal and Vertical States**:
   - Use the generated states to create all possible combinations of horizontal and vertical clues applied to the grid.

The function will return a list of all possible successor states derived from applying each horizontal or vertical clue one at a time. 

Here's the Python code to achieve this:

```python
def generate_successor_states(state, horizontal_answers, vertical_answers):
    import copy
    
    def apply_horizontal(state, answers):
        rows, cols = len(state), len(state[0])
        new_states = []
        for row in range(rows):
            for answer in answers[row]:
                if len(answer) == cols:
                    new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
                    new_state[row] = list(answer)
                    new_states.append(new_state)
        return new_states
    
    def apply_vertical(state, answers):
        rows, cols = len(state), len(state[0])
        new_states = []
        for col in range(cols):
            for answer in answers[col]:
                if len(answer) == rows:
                    new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
                    for row in range(rows):
                        new_state[row][col] = answer[row]
                    new_states.append(new_state)
        return new_states
    
    horizontal_states = apply_horizontal(state, horizontal_answers)
    vertical_states = apply_vertical(state, vertical_answers)
    
    return horizontal_states + vertical_states
```

This function:
- Defines initial functions to apply horizontal and vertical clues.
- Generates new states by applying one answer from the lists of possible horizontal and vertical answers, respectively.
- Combines the resultant states from both horizontal and vertical clue applications. 

This approach ensures all possible successors of the state are generated by applying each clue answer separately.

AutoToS prompt:

Please provide a goal test function in Python ensuring that all cells are not None, all words horizontally are matching at least one of the horizontal answers, and all words vertically match at least one of the vertical answers. The function should receive a state, horizontal_answers, and vertical_answers as before and return True for a goal state and False otherwise.

Model response:
To create a goal test function that ensures all cells in the crossword grid are not `None` and that all words (both horizontally and vertically) match at least one of the possible answers provided, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Non-Null Cells**: Check that no cell in the grid is `None`.

2. **Validate Horizontal Words**:
   - Extract each row from the grid.
   - Verify that each row matches one of the possible answers for that row.

3. **Validate Vertical Words**:
   - Extract each column from the grid.
   - Verify that each column matches one of the possible answers for that column.

Here's the Python code to achieve the goal test function:

```python
def is_goal_state(state, horizontal_answers, vertical_answers):
    def validate_horizontal(state, horizontal_answers):
        for row in range(len(state)):
            word = ''.join(state[row])
            if word not in horizontal_answers[row]:
                return False
        return True
    
    def validate_vertical(state, vertical_answers):
        for col in range(len(state[0])):
            word = ''.join(state[row][col] for row in range(len(state)))
            if word not in vertical_answers[col]:
                return False
        return True
    
    def all_cells_filled(state):
        for row in state:
            if None in row:
                return False
        return True
    
    if not all_cells_filled(state):
        return False
    
    if not validate_horizontal(state, horizontal_answers):
        return False
    
    if not validate_vertical(state, vertical_answers):
        return False
    
    return True
```

This function:
1. **`validate_horizontal`**: Checks if each horizontal word in the grid matches one of the possible answers.
2. **`validate_vertical`**: Checks if each vertical word in the grid matches one of the possible answers.
3. **`all_cells_filled`**: Ensures no cell in the grid is `None`.

Finally, the `is_goal_state` function checks all three conditions and returns `True` if they are all satisfied, and `False` otherwise.
