The task is a 5x5 mini crosswords. A state is a 2D array representing the current puzzle state, where the initial grid is all "None". Note that some of the possible answers are not exactly 5 character long. Given an input of possible answers to horizontal clues and vertical clues, how is the successor state function defined? Please first think step by step. Then provide the successor state function in Python code. 

The possible clues for each row and each column are given separately. Here is an example of possible horizontal and vertical clues:

horizontal_answers = [
        ["tasks", "goals", "plans", "agend", "chores", "works", "deeds", "items", "lists", "brief"],
        ["motor", "power", "drive", "diesel", "steam", "pumps", "crank", "gears", "turbn", "motor"],
        ["grand", "artsy", "showy", "ornate", "fancy", "vain", "proud", "vogue", "swank", "luxus"], 
        ["venue", "salle", "forum", "atria", "lobby", "parls", "court", "malls", "mall", "lobby"], 
        ["jeer", "scoff", "sleer", "deris", "sneer", "scorn", "derid", "gibes", "gibed", "flout"] 
]
vertical_answers = [
        ["amass", "stack", "hoard", "pile", "store", "heaps", "massy", "gathe", "lumps", "mound"],
        ["nilga", "goral", "eland", "lepus", "gazal", "kudu", "oryx", "gnu", "imps", "carb"],
        ["scheme", "design", "ettle", "nettle", "sting", "wiles", "plans", "ideas", "plots", "cocks"], 
        ["spout", "nosle", "snout", "mouth", "nostr", "ports", "inlet", "vents", "outlt", "beaks"], 
        ["drier", "arid", "sere", "parch", "dryer", "wring", "drear", "sear", "pall", "lack"]
]

where horizontal_answers is a list where element i is a list of possible answers to clue in row i, and vertical_answers is a list where element i is a list of possible answers to clue in column i.

Model response:
To define the `successor_state` function, we need to carefully consider the task of updating the state of the 5x5 mini-crossword puzzle. We'll generate all possible valid states by inserting answers from the horizontal and vertical clues such that there are no contradictions in the filled cells.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial state as a 5x5 grid with all cells set to `None`.

2. **Generate Horizontal Candidates**: Insert each possible horizontal answer for each row sequentially.

3. **Validate Horizontal Insertion**: After inserting a horizontal answer, generate all possible valid states by checking if the vertical constraints are satisfied.

4. **Generate Successor States**: Once a horizontal answer is placed, iterate over vertical clues to finalize the puzzle by filling vertical slots in compatible ways.

5. **Check Consistency**: Ensure that the horizontal and vertical answers do not contradict each other.

Here is the complete function definition in Python:

```python
def successor_state(horizontal_answers, vertical_answers):
    import copy

    def is_valid_horizontal(state, row, word):
        for col in range(5):
            if state[row][col] is not None and state[row][col] != word[col]:
                return False
        return True

    def is_valid_vertical(state, col, word):
        for row in range(5):
            if state[row][col] is not None and state[row][col] != word[row]:
                return False
        return True

    def generate_states(state, is_vertical=False):
        positions = range(5)
        answers = vertical_answers if is_vertical else horizontal_answers
        
        for pos in positions:
            for word in answers[pos]:
                if len(word) == 5:
                    if is_vertical:
                        if is_valid_vertical(state, pos, word):
                            new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
                            for row in range(5):
                                new_state[row][pos] = word[row]
                            yield new_state
                    else:
                        if is_valid_horizontal(state, pos, word):
                            new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
                            for col in range(5):
                                new_state[pos][col] = word[col]
                            yield new_state

    initial_state = [[None]*5 for _ in range(5)]
    all_horizontal_states = list(generate_states(initial_state))
    valid_states = []

    for h_state in all_horizontal_states:
        for v_state in generate_states(h_state, is_vertical=True):
            valid_states.append(v_state)

    return valid_states
```

This function creates a list of all valid states of the crossword puzzle by sequentially filling horizontal and vertical answers while ensuring the constraints are satisfied. It returns a list of all such valid successor states.

AutoToS prompt:

Please provide a goal test function in Python ensuring that all cells are not None, all words horizontally are matching at least one of the horizontal answers, and all words vertically match at least one of the vertical answers. The function should receive a state, horizontal_answers, and vertical_answers as before and return True for a goal state and False otherwise.

Model response:
To define the `goal_test` function, we need to check the following conditions for a given state:
1. All cells must be filled (not `None`).
2. Each horizontal word must be present in the corresponding list of possible horizontal answers.
3. Each vertical word must be present in the corresponding list of possible vertical answers.

Here is the `goal_test` function in Python:

```python
def goal_test(state, horizontal_answers, vertical_answers):
    def check_horizontal_words(state, horizontal_answers):
        for i, row in enumerate(state):
            word = ''.join(row)
            if word not in horizontal_answers[i]:
                return False
        return True

    def check_vertical_words(state, vertical_answers):
        for col in range(5):
            word = ''.join(state[row][col] for row in range(5))
            if word not in vertical_answers[col]:
                return False
        return True

    def all_cells_filled(state):
        for row in state:
            if None in row:
                return False
        return True

    return all_cells_filled(state) and check_horizontal_words(state, horizontal_answers) and check_vertical_words(state, vertical_answers)
```

This function first ensures that all cells are filled, then checks each row to see if it matches one of the provided horizontal answers, and finally checks each column to see if it matches one of the provided vertical answers. It returns `True` if all these conditions are met (indicating a goal state) and `False` otherwise.

AutoToS prompt:
The following exception was produced when testing the successor function: 
  File "autoToS/src/crossword5by5/crossword_experiments.py", line 72, in successor_states_f
    return successor_states(state, horizontal_answers, vertical_answers)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

successor_state() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given. Please fix this exception in the successor function.
Model response:
I apologize for the oversight. The `successor_state` function needs to take the current state as an input along with the horizontal and vertical answers. Additionally, the previous function didn't handle starting from an arbitrary state, which is necessary for generating successor states from any given state in the puzzle.

Here's the corrected `successor_state` function:

```python
def successor_state(state, horizontal_answers, vertical_answers):
    import copy

    def is_valid_horizontal(existing_state, row, word):
        for col in range(5):
            if existing_state[row][col] is not None and existing_state[row][col] != word[col]:
                return False
        return True

    def is_valid_vertical(existing_state, col, word):
        for row in range(5):
            if existing_state[row][col] is not None and existing_state[row][col] != word[row]:
                return False
        return True

    def generate_states_from_state(existing_state, is_vertical=False):
        positions = range(5)
        answers = vertical_answers if is_vertical else horizontal_answers
        
        for pos in positions:
            for word in answers[pos]:
                if len(word) == 5:
                    if is_valid_vertical(existing_state, pos, word) if is_vertical else is_valid_horizontal(existing_state, pos, word):
                        new_state = copy.deepcopy(existing_state)
                        if is_vertical:
                            for row in range(5):
                                new_state[row][pos] = word[row]
                        else:
                            for col in range(5):
                                new_state[pos][col] = word[col]
                        yield new_state

    all_horizontal_states = list(generate_states_from_state(state))
    valid_states = []

    for h_state in all_horizontal_states:
        for v_state in generate_states_from_state(h_state, is_vertical=True):
            valid_states.append(v_state)

    return valid_states
```

Now, `successor_state` takes the current state as the first parameter, followed by the horizontal and vertical clues. This function generates valid successor states starting from any arbitrary state.
