The task is a 5x5 mini crosswords. A state is a 2D array representing the current puzzle state, where the initial grid is all "None". Note that some of the possible answers are not exactly 5 character long. Given an input of possible answers to horizontal clues and vertical clues, how is the successor state function defined? Please first think step by step. Then provide the successor state function in Python code. 

The possible clues for each row and each column are given separately. Here is an example of possible horizontal and vertical clues:

horizontal_answers = [
        ["tasks", "goals", "plans", "agend", "chores", "works", "deeds", "items", "lists", "brief"],
        ["motor", "power", "drive", "diesel", "steam", "pumps", "crank", "gears", "turbn", "motor"],
        ["grand", "artsy", "showy", "ornate", "fancy", "vain", "proud", "vogue", "swank", "luxus"], 
        ["venue", "salle", "forum", "atria", "lobby", "parls", "court", "malls", "mall", "lobby"], 
        ["jeer", "scoff", "sleer", "deris", "sneer", "scorn", "derid", "gibes", "gibed", "flout"] 
]
vertical_answers = [
        ["amass", "stack", "hoard", "pile", "store", "heaps", "massy", "gathe", "lumps", "mound"],
        ["nilga", "goral", "eland", "lepus", "gazal", "kudu", "oryx", "gnu", "imps", "carb"],
        ["scheme", "design", "ettle", "nettle", "sting", "wiles", "plans", "ideas", "plots", "cocks"], 
        ["spout", "nosle", "snout", "mouth", "nostr", "ports", "inlet", "vents", "outlt", "beaks"], 
        ["drier", "arid", "sere", "parch", "dryer", "wring", "drear", "sear", "pall", "lack"]
]

where horizontal_answers is a list where element i is a list of possible answers to clue in row i, and vertical_answers is a list where element i is a list of possible answers to clue in column i.

Model response:
To define the successor state function for the 5x5 crossword puzzle, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize the puzzle grid state as a 5x5 list of lists with each cell starting as `None`.
2. Define a function that takes in the current state of the puzzle, possible horizontal answers, and possible vertical answers.
3. Iterate through the grid to check which rows and columns still need answers (i.e., rows and columns that contain `None` values).
4. For each row and column that contains `None` values, iterate over possible answers and place each possible answer in the grid to generate successor states.
5. Return all valid successor states.

Here’s the Python function to generate the successor state based on the given steps:

```python
import copy

def successor_states(state, horizontal_answers, vertical_answers):
    def is_valid_vertical(state, col):
        for row in range(5):
            if state[row][col] is None:
                return True
        return False

    def is_valid_horizontal(state, row):
        for col in range(5):
            if state[row][col] is None:
                return True
        return False

    def apply_horizontal_answer(state, row, answer):
        new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
        for col in range(min(len(answer), 5)):
            new_state[row][col] = answer[col]
        return new_state

    def apply_vertical_answer(state, col, answer):
        new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
        for row in range(min(len(answer), 5)):
            new_state[row][col] = answer[row]
        return new_state

    successors = []

    # Generate horizontal successor states
    for row in range(5):
        if is_valid_horizontal(state, row):
            for answer in horizontal_answers[row]:
                if len(answer) <= 5:
                    new_state = apply_horizontal_answer(state, row, answer)
                    successors.append(new_state)

    # Generate vertical successor states
    for col in range(5):
        if is_valid_vertical(state, col):
            for answer in vertical_answers[col]:
                if len(answer) <= 5:
                    new_state = apply_vertical_answer(state, col, answer)
                    successors.append(new_state)

    return successors
```

AutoToS prompt:

Please provide a goal test function in Python ensuring that all cells are not None, all words horizontally are matching at least one of the horizontal answers, and all words vertically match at least one of the vertical answers. The function should receive a state, horizontal_answers, and vertical_answers as before and return True for a goal state and False otherwise.

Model response:
To implement the goal test function, we need to verify three conditions:
1. All cells in the state are filled (i.e., no cell is `None`).
2. All horizontal words in the state match at least one of the given horizontal answers.
3. All vertical words in the state match at least one of the given vertical answers.

Here’s the Python function to perform the goal test:

```python
def goal_test(state, horizontal_answers, vertical_answers):
    def is_filled(state):
        for row in state:
            for cell in row:
                if cell is None:
                    return False
        return True

    def get_horizontal_word(state, row):
        return ''.join(state[row])

    def get_vertical_word(state, col):
        return ''.join(state[row][col] for row in range(5))

    if not is_filled(state):
        return False

    for row in range(5):
        word = get_horizontal_word(state, row)
        if word not in horizontal_answers[row]:
            return False

    for col in range(5):
        word = get_vertical_word(state, col)
        if word not in vertical_answers[col]:
            return False

    return True
```
