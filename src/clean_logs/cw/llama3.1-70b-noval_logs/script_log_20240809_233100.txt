The task is a 5x5 mini crosswords. A state is a 2D array representing the current puzzle state, where the initial grid is all "None". Note that some of the possible answers are not exactly 5 character long. Given an input of possible answers to horizontal clues and vertical clues, how is the successor state function defined? Please first think step by step. Then provide the successor state function in Python code. 

The possible clues for each row and each column are given separately. Here is an example of possible horizontal and vertical clues:

horizontal_answers = [
        ["tasks", "goals", "plans", "agend", "chores", "works", "deeds", "items", "lists", "brief"],
        ["motor", "power", "drive", "diesel", "steam", "pumps", "crank", "gears", "turbn", "motor"],
        ["grand", "artsy", "showy", "ornate", "fancy", "vain", "proud", "vogue", "swank", "luxus"], 
        ["venue", "salle", "forum", "atria", "lobby", "parls", "court", "malls", "mall", "lobby"], 
        ["jeer", "scoff", "sleer", "deris", "sneer", "scorn", "derid", "gibes", "gibed", "flout"] 
]
vertical_answers = [
        ["amass", "stack", "hoard", "pile", "store", "heaps", "massy", "gathe", "lumps", "mound"],
        ["nilga", "goral", "eland", "lepus", "gazal", "kudu", "oryx", "gnu", "imps", "carb"],
        ["scheme", "design", "ettle", "nettle", "sting", "wiles", "plans", "ideas", "plots", "cocks"], 
        ["spout", "nosle", "snout", "mouth", "nostr", "ports", "inlet", "vents", "outlt", "beaks"], 
        ["drier", "arid", "sere", "parch", "dryer", "wring", "drear", "sear", "pall", "lack"]
]

where horizontal_answers is a list where element i is a list of possible answers to clue in row i, and vertical_answers is a list where element i is a list of possible answers to clue in column i.

Model response:
To define the successor state function, we need to consider the possible moves that can be made from the current state. In a crossword puzzle, a move consists of filling in a word in an empty space. We can iterate through each row and column, and for each one, try to fill in a word from the corresponding list of possible answers.
Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the successor state function:
Iterate through each row (i) and column (j) in the 5x5 grid.
For each row, iterate through the list of possible answers for that row.
For each answer, check if it can be placed in the current row, starting from the current column. This means checking if the length of the answer is less than or equal to the remaining empty spaces in the row, and if the answer does not conflict with any already-filled words.
If an answer can be placed, create a new state by filling in the answer in the corresponding spaces in the grid.
Repeat steps 2-4 for each column.
Return a list of all possible successor states.
Here is the Python code for the successor state function:
Python
```
def successor_state(state, horizontal_answers, vertical_answers):
    successor_states = []
    for i in range(5):  # rows
        for j in range(5):  # columns
            if state[i][j] is None:  # if space is empty
                # Try horizontal answers
                for answer in horizontal_answers[i]:
                    if len(answer) <= 5 - j:  # if answer fits in remaining space
                        new_state = [row[:] for row in state]  # copy state
                        for k in range(len(answer)):
                            new_state[i][j + k] = answer[k]
                        successor_states.append(new_state)
                # Try vertical answers
                for answer in vertical_answers[j]:
                    if len(answer) <= 5 - i:  # if answer fits in remaining space
                        new_state = [row[:] for row in state]  # copy state
                        for k in range(len(answer)):
                            new_state[i + k][j] = answer[k]
                        successor_states.append(new_state)
    return successor_states
```
Note that this function assumes that the input state is a 5x5 grid represented as a list of lists, where each element is either a string (a filled-in word) or None (an empty space). The function returns a list of possible successor states, each represented in the same format

AutoToS prompt:

Please provide a goal test function in Python ensuring that all cells are not None, all words horizontally are matching at least one of the horizontal answers, and all words vertically match at least one of the vertical answers. The function should receive a state, horizontal_answers, and vertical_answers as before and return True for a goal state and False otherwise.

Model response:
Here is a Python function that implements the goal test:
Python
```
def goal_test(state, horizontal_answers, vertical_answers):
    # Check all cells are filled
    if any(cell is None for row in state for cell in row):
        return False

    # Check horizontal answers
    for i, row in enumerate(state):
        row_word = ''.join(row)
        if not any(row_word == answer or row_word in answer for answer in horizontal_answers[i]):
            return False

    # Check vertical answers
    for j in range(5):
        col_word = ''.join(row[j] for row in state)
        if not any(col_word == answer or col_word in answer for answer in vertical_answers[j]):
            return False

    return True
```
Here's an explanation of the code:
First, we check if all cells in the state are filled by checking if any cell is None. If so, we return False.
Next, we iterate through each row and construct the word by joining the cells. We then check if the word matches any of the possible horizontal answers for that row. If not, we return False.
We do the same for vertical answers, iterating through each column and constructing the word by joining the cells. We check if the word matches any of the possible vertical answers for that column. If not, we return False.
If we pass all checks, we return True, indicating that the state is a goal state.
Note that we use the any function to check if the word matches any of the possible answers. We also use the in operator to check if the word is a substring of any of the possible answers, in case the word is shorter than the possible answer
