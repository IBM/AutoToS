The task is a 5x5 mini crosswords. A state is a 2D array representing the current puzzle state, where the initial grid is all "None". Note that some of the possible answers are not exactly 5 character long. Given an input of possible answers to horizontal clues and vertical clues, how is the successor state function defined? Please first think step by step. Then provide the successor state function in Python code. 

The possible clues for each row and each column are given separately. Here is an example of possible horizontal and vertical clues:

horizontal_answers = [
        ["tasks", "goals", "plans", "agend", "chores", "works", "deeds", "items", "lists", "brief"],
        ["motor", "power", "drive", "diesel", "steam", "pumps", "crank", "gears", "turbn", "motor"],
        ["grand", "artsy", "showy", "ornate", "fancy", "vain", "proud", "vogue", "swank", "luxus"], 
        ["venue", "salle", "forum", "atria", "lobby", "parls", "court", "malls", "mall", "lobby"], 
        ["jeer", "scoff", "sleer", "deris", "sneer", "scorn", "derid", "gibes", "gibed", "flout"] 
]
vertical_answers = [
        ["amass", "stack", "hoard", "pile", "store", "heaps", "massy", "gathe", "lumps", "mound"],
        ["nilga", "goral", "eland", "lepus", "gazal", "kudu", "oryx", "gnu", "imps", "carb"],
        ["scheme", "design", "ettle", "nettle", "sting", "wiles", "plans", "ideas", "plots", "cocks"], 
        ["spout", "nosle", "snout", "mouth", "nostr", "ports", "inlet", "vents", "outlt", "beaks"], 
        ["drier", "arid", "sere", "parch", "dryer", "wring", "drear", "sear", "pall", "lack"]
]

where horizontal_answers is a list where element i is a list of possible answers to clue in row i, and vertical_answers is a list where element i is a list of possible answers to clue in column i.

Model response:
To define the successor state function for a 5x5 mini crosswords puzzle, we need to consider how to update the puzzle state based on the given possible answers for horizontal and vertical clues. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Initialize the Puzzle State**: Start with a 5x5 grid filled with `None` values.
2. **Iterate Over Possible Answers**: For each row and column, try to place the possible answers in the grid.
3. **Check Validity**: Ensure that placing an answer does not conflict with already placed answers in the grid.
4. **Update the State**: If a valid placement is found, update the grid and proceed to the next row or column.

The successor state function will take the current state of the puzzle and the lists of possible answers for horizontal and vertical clues, and return the updated state.

Here is the Python code for the successor state function:

python
```
def successor_state(current_state, horizontal_answers, vertical_answers):
    def can_place(state, answer, row, col, is_horizontal):
        for i, char in enumerate(answer):
            if is_horizontal:
                if state[row][col + i] is not None and state[row][col + i] != char:
                    return False
            else:
                if state[row + i][col] is not None and state[row + i][col] != char:
                    return False
        return True

    def place_answer(state, answer, row, col, is_horizontal):
        for i, char in enumerate(answer):
            if is_horizontal:
                state[row][col + i] = char
            else:
                state[row + i][col] = char

    new_state = [row[:] for row in current_state]

    for row in range(5):
        for answer in horizontal_answers[row]:
            if len(answer) <= 5 and can_place(new_state, answer, row, 0, True):
                place_answer(new_state, answer, row, 0, True)
                break

    for col in range(5):
        for answer in vertical_answers[col]:
            if len(answer) <= 5 and can_place(new_state, answer, 0, col, False):
                place_answer(new_state, answer, 0, col, False)
                break

    return new_state
```

This function works as follows:
- **`can_place`**: Checks if an answer can be placed in the specified row and column without conflicts.
- **`place_answer`**: Places the answer in the specified row and column.
- **Main Logic**: Iterates over each row and column, trying to place the possible answers. If a valid placement is found, it updates the state and moves to the next row or column.

This function ensures that the puzzle state is updated correctly based on the given possible answers for horizontal and vertical clues

AutoToS prompt:

Please provide a goal test function in Python ensuring that all cells are not None, all words horizontally are matching at least one of the horizontal answers, and all words vertically match at least one of the vertical answers. The function should receive a state, horizontal_answers, and vertical_answers as before and return True for a goal state and False otherwise.

Model response:
Certainly! Here is the goal test function in Python that checks if the given state meets the criteria for a goal state:

python
```
def goal_test(state, horizontal_answers, vertical_answers):
    # Check if all cells are not None
    for row in state:
        if None in row:
            return False

    # Check if all horizontal words match at least one of the horizontal answers
    for i, row in enumerate(state):
        word = ''.join(row)
        if word not in horizontal_answers[i]:
            return False

    # Check if all vertical words match at least one of the vertical answers
    for j in range(5):
        word = ''.join(state[i][j] for i in range(5))
        if word not in vertical_answers[j]:
            return False

    return True
```

This function performs the following checks:
1. **All Cells Not None**: It iterates through each row of the state to ensure that no cell contains `None`.
2. **Horizontal Word Matching**: For each row, it constructs the word by joining the characters and checks if this word is present in the corresponding list of horizontal answers.
3. **Vertical Word Matching**: For each column, it constructs the word by joining the characters from each row in that column and checks if this word is present in the corresponding list of vertical answers.

If all these conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that the state is a goal state. Otherwise, it returns `False`

AutoToS prompt:
Successor state has more than 5 filled cells more than the parent state.
Let's think step by step. First, think what you did wrong.
Then, think of in what ways successor state should be different from the parent state.
Then, provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that returns a list of successor states.
Remember how you fixed the previous mistakes, if any. Keep the same function signature.

Input state: [[None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None]]
Example wrong successor state: ['t', 'a', 's', 'k', 's']
Horizontal clues: [['tasks', 'goals', 'plans', 'agend', 'chores', 'works', 'deeds', 'items', 'lists', 'brief'], ['motor', 'power', 'drive', 'diesel', 'steam', 'pumps', 'crank', 'gears', 'turbn', 'motor'], ['grand', 'artsy', 'showy', 'ornate', 'fancy', 'vain', 'proud', 'vogue', 'swank', 'luxus'], ['venue', 'salle', 'forum', 'atria', 'lobby', 'parls', 'court', 'malls', 'mall', 'lobby'], ['jeer', 'scoff', 'sleer', 'deris', 'sneer', 'scorn', 'derid', 'gibes', 'gibed', 'flout']]
Vertical clues: [['amass', 'stack', 'hoard', 'pile', 'store', 'heaps', 'massy', 'gathe', 'lumps', 'mound'], ['nilga', 'goral', 'eland', 'lepus', 'gazal', 'kudu', 'oryx', 'gnu', 'imps', 'carb'], ['scheme', 'design', 'ettle', 'nettle', 'sting', 'wiles', 'plans', 'ideas', 'plots', 'cocks'], ['spout', 'nosle', 'snout', 'mouth', 'nostr', 'ports', 'inlet', 'vents', 'outlt', 'beaks'], ['drier', 'arid', 'sere', 'parch', 'dryer', 'wring', 'drear', 'sear', 'pall', 'lack']]

Model response:
Let's analyze the issues and revise the successor state function step by step.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Overfilling Cells**: The previous successor function might have filled more than 5 cells at once, which is incorrect for a 5x5 crossword puzzle.
2. **Incorrect State Representation**: The successor state should be a 2D array, not a single list of characters.
3. **Lack of Multiple Successor States**: The function should return a list of possible successor states, not just one.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Generate Possible Placements**: For each row and column, generate all possible valid placements of answers.
2. **Check Validity**: Ensure that placing an answer does not conflict with already placed answers in the grid.
3. **Return List of Successor States**: Collect all valid successor states and return them as a list.

### Revised Successor State Function:
Here is the revised successor state function that returns a list of successor states:

python
```
def successor_state(current_state, horizontal_answers, vertical_answers):
    def can_place(state, answer, row, col, is_horizontal):
        for i, char in enumerate(answer):
            if is_horizontal:
                if state[row][col + i] is not None and state[row][col + i] != char:
                    return False
            else:
                if state[row + i][col] is not None and state[row + i][col] != char:
                    return False
        return True

    def place_answer(state, answer, row, col, is_horizontal):
        new_state = [row[:] for row in state]
        for i, char in enumerate(answer):
            if is_horizontal:
                new_state[row][col + i] = char
            else:
                new_state[row + i][col] = char
        return new_state

    successor_states = []

    # Try placing horizontal answers
    for row in range(5):
        for answer in horizontal_answers[row]:
            if len(answer) <= 5 and can_place(current_state, answer, row, 0, True):
                new_state = place_answer(current_state, answer, row, 0, True)
                successor_states.append(new_state)

    # Try placing vertical answers
    for col in range(5):
        for answer in vertical_answers[col]:
            if len(answer) <= 5 and can_place(current_state, answer, 0, col, False):
                new_state = place_answer(current_state, answer, 0, col, False)
                successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```

### Explanation:
1. **`can_place` Function**: Checks if an answer can be placed in the specified row and column without conflicts.
2. **`place_answer` Function**: Creates a new state by placing the answer in the specified row and column.
3. **Main Logic**: Iterates over each row and column, trying to place the possible answers. If a valid placement is found, it adds the new state to the list of successor states.

This function ensures that each successor state is a valid extension of the current state and returns a list of all possible valid successor states
Successor Iteration 2

AutoToS prompt:
Successor state has the same number of filled cells as the parent state.
Let's think step by step. First, think what you did wrong.
Then, think of in what ways successor state should be different from the parent state.
Then, provide the complete Python code for the revised successor function that returns a list of successor states.

Model response:
Let's analyze the issues and revise the successor state function step by step.

### Issues Identified:
1. **No Change in State**: The previous successor function returned states that were identical to the parent state, which is incorrect.
2. **Incomplete Placement Check**: The function did not properly check for conflicts when placing answers, leading to invalid states.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Generate Possible Placements**: For each row and column, generate all possible valid placements of answers that extend the current state.
2. **Check Validity**: Ensure that placing an answer does not conflict with already placed answers in the grid and that it extends the current state.
3. **Return List of Successor States**: Collect all valid successor states and return them as a list.

### Revised Successor State Function:
Here is the revised successor state function that returns a list of successor states:

python
```
def successor_state(current_state, horizontal_answers, vertical_answers):
    def can_place(state, answer, row, col, is_horizontal):
        for i, char in enumerate(answer):
            if is_horizontal:
                if col + i >= 5 or (state[row][col + i] is not None and state[row][col + i] != char):
                    return False
            else:
                if row + i >= 5 or (state[row + i][col] is not None and state[row + i][col] != char):
                    return False
        return True

    def place_answer(state, answer, row, col, is_horizontal):
        new_state = [row[:] for row in state]
        for i, char in enumerate(answer):
            if is_horizontal:
                new_state[row][col + i] = char
            else:
                new_state[row + i][col] = char
        return new_state

    successor_states = []

    # Try placing horizontal answers
    for row in range(5):
        for answer in horizontal_answers[row]:
            for col in range(5):
                if col + len(answer) <= 5 and can_place(current_state, answer, row, col, True):
                    new_state = place_answer(current_state, answer, row, col, True)
                    if new_state != current_state:
                        successor_states.append(new_state)

    # Try placing vertical answers
    for col in range(5):
        for answer in vertical_answers[col]:
            for row in range(5):
                if row + len(answer) <= 5 and can_place(current_state, answer, row, col, False):
                    new_state = place_answer(current_state, answer, row, col, False)
                    if new_state != current_state:
                        successor_states.append(new_state)

    return successor_states
```

### Explanation:
1. **`can_place` Function**: Checks if an answer can be placed in the specified row and column without conflicts and within the grid bounds.
2. **`place_answer` Function**: Creates a new state by placing the answer in the specified row and column.
3. **Main Logic**: Iterates over each row and column, trying to place the possible answers starting from each cell. If a valid placement is found that extends the current state, it adds the new state to the list of successor states.

This function ensures that each successor state is a valid extension of the current state and returns a list of all possible valid successor states
