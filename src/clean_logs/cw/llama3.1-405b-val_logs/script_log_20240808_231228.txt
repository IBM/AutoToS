The task is a 5x5 mini crosswords. A state is a 2D array representing the current puzzle state, where the initial grid is all "None". Note that some of the possible answers are not exactly 5 character long. Given an input of possible answers to horizontal clues and vertical clues, how is the successor state function defined? Please first think step by step. Then provide the successor state function in Python code. 

The possible clues for each row and each column are given separately. Here is an example of possible horizontal and vertical clues:

horizontal_answers = [
        ["tasks", "goals", "plans", "agend", "chores", "works", "deeds", "items", "lists", "brief"],
        ["motor", "power", "drive", "diesel", "steam", "pumps", "crank", "gears", "turbn", "motor"],
        ["grand", "artsy", "showy", "ornate", "fancy", "vain", "proud", "vogue", "swank", "luxus"], 
        ["venue", "salle", "forum", "atria", "lobby", "parls", "court", "malls", "mall", "lobby"], 
        ["jeer", "scoff", "sleer", "deris", "sneer", "scorn", "derid", "gibes", "gibed", "flout"] 
]
vertical_answers = [
        ["amass", "stack", "hoard", "pile", "store", "heaps", "massy", "gathe", "lumps", "mound"],
        ["nilga", "goral", "eland", "lepus", "gazal", "kudu", "oryx", "gnu", "imps", "carb"],
        ["scheme", "design", "ettle", "nettle", "sting", "wiles", "plans", "ideas", "plots", "cocks"], 
        ["spout", "nosle", "snout", "mouth", "nostr", "ports", "inlet", "vents", "outlt", "beaks"], 
        ["drier", "arid", "sere", "parch", "dryer", "wring", "drear", "sear", "pall", "lack"]
]

where horizontal_answers is a list where element i is a list of possible answers to clue in row i, and vertical_answers is a list where element i is a list of possible answers to clue in column i.

Successor State Function for 5x5 Mini Crosswords
Step-by-Step Thought Process
To define the successor state function, we need to consider the possible next states given a current state and the possible answers to horizontal and vertical clues. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
Current State: The current state is a 2D array (5x5 grid) where each cell can be either None (empty) or a character (part of a word).
Possible Next States: For each empty cell in the current state, we need to consider all possible characters that can fill that cell based on the given horizontal and vertical clues.
Horizontal Clues: For each row, we have a list of possible answers. We need to check which of these answers can be placed in the current row, considering the already filled cells.
Vertical Clues: Similarly, for each column, we have a list of possible answers. We need to check which of these answers can be placed in the current column, considering the already filled cells.
Successor State: A successor state is a new 2D array where one empty cell is filled with a character based on the possible answers to horizontal and vertical clues.

        vertical_answers (list of lists): List of possible answers to vertical clues for each column.

                            new_state[i][j + k] = char

                        new_state = [row[:] for row in current_state]  # Create a copy of the current state
                        for k, char in enumerate(answer):
                            new_state[i + k][j] = char
                        successor_states.append(new_state)
    return successor_states
```
This function returns a list of possible successor states, where each successor state is a new 2D array with one empty cell filled with a character based on the possible answers to horizontal and vertical clues. Note that this implementation assumes that the input current state, horizontal answers, and vertical answers are valid and consistent with the problem description.

AutoToS prompt:

Please provide a goal test function in Python ensuring that all cells are not None, all words horizontally are matching at least one of the horizontal answers, and all words vertically match at least one of the vertical answers. The function should receive a state, horizontal_answers, and vertical_answers as before and return True for a goal state and False otherwise.

    A goal state is a state where:

This function first checks if all cells in the state are not None. Then, it checks if each row matches at least one of the horizontal answers. Finally, it checks if each column matches at least one of the vertical answers. If all checks pass, the function returns True, indicating that the state is a goal state. Otherwise, it returns False.
You can use this function to test if a given state is a goal state, like this:
Python
state = [
    ['t', 'a', 's', 'k', 's'],
    ['m', 'o', 't', 'o', 'r'],
    ['g', 'r', 'a', 'n', 'd'],

    ['j', 'e', 'e', 'r', 's']
