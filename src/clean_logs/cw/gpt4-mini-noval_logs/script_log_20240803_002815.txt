The task is a 5x5 mini crosswords. A state is a 2D array representing the current puzzle state, where the initial grid is all "None". Note that some of the possible answers are not exactly 5 character long. Given an input of possible answers to horizontal clues and vertical clues, how is the successor state function defined? Please first think step by step. Then provide the successor state function in Python code. 

The possible clues for each row and each column are given separately. Here is an example of possible horizontal and vertical clues:

horizontal_answers = [
        ["tasks", "goals", "plans", "agend", "chores", "works", "deeds", "items", "lists", "brief"],
        ["motor", "power", "drive", "diesel", "steam", "pumps", "crank", "gears", "turbn", "motor"],
        ["grand", "artsy", "showy", "ornate", "fancy", "vain", "proud", "vogue", "swank", "luxus"], 
        ["venue", "salle", "forum", "atria", "lobby", "parls", "court", "malls", "mall", "lobby"], 
        ["jeer", "scoff", "sleer", "deris", "sneer", "scorn", "derid", "gibes", "gibed", "flout"] 
]
vertical_answers = [
        ["amass", "stack", "hoard", "pile", "store", "heaps", "massy", "gathe", "lumps", "mound"],
        ["nilga", "goral", "eland", "lepus", "gazal", "kudu", "oryx", "gnu", "imps", "carb"],
        ["scheme", "design", "ettle", "nettle", "sting", "wiles", "plans", "ideas", "plots", "cocks"], 
        ["spout", "nosle", "snout", "mouth", "nostr", "ports", "inlet", "vents", "outlt", "beaks"], 
        ["drier", "arid", "sere", "parch", "dryer", "wring", "drear", "sear", "pall", "lack"]
]

where horizontal_answers is a list where element i is a list of possible answers to clue in row i, and vertical_answers is a list where element i is a list of possible answers to clue in column i.

Please provide a goal test function in Python ensuring that all cells are not None, all words horizontally are matching at least one of the horizontal answers, and all words vertically match at least one of the vertical answers.

This function should ensure that you're not attempting to join `NoneType` values. The checks on the column and row states ensure they are completely empty (all `None`) before making any changes.

        return new_state

    return create_successor(state)

This version of the `successor_state` function ensures that the bounds for both the rows and columns are correctly utilized. You should ensure that `horizontal_answers` and `vertical_answers` both contain at least 5 entries to prevent an "index out of range" exception.

        return new_state

    return create_successor(state)
``` 

In this updated implementation of `successor_state`, I made sure to isolate the checks for empty rows and columns. By ensuring that we only attempt to fill these cells when they are confirmed to be empty, we reduce the risk of encountering `NoneType` values when checking the conditions in the `goal_test` function.

        return new_state

    return create_successor(state)
``` 

In this version, I've ensured that when filling the state, it does not mistakenly try to use `NoneType` in string operations. The function checks if a row or column is empty and only then assigns values from the corresponding answers. Also, the last loop ensures that any remaining `None` are explicitly set again, which is more of a safeguard here. Make sure that your tests for `goal_test` do not inadvertently pass `NoneType` into string operations.

In this version, I've made sure to clearly check if cells are `None` before assigning new values from answers. This aims to avoid any scenario where you could get `NoneType` involved in string operations, which could lead to the exception you encountered. Please ensure your input to the `goal_test` does not include any improper initial states as well.

Model response:
To resolve the issue of `NoneType` causing exceptions in the `goal_test` function, let's modify the `successor_state` function to ensure that it does not leave any `None` values in the completed rows and columns. Instead, it will ensure that all cells are filled before returning the state.

Here’s the revised `successor_state` function:

```python
def successor_state(state, horizontal_answers, vertical_answers):
    import random

    def create_successor(state):
        new_state = [row[:] for row in state]

        for i in range(5):
            if all(cell is None for cell in new_state[i]):  # Check if the row is completely empty
                if horizontal_answers[i]:  # Ensure there are possible answers for this row
                    answer = random.choice(horizontal_answers[i])  # Choose a random answer
                    new_state[i] = list(answer)  # Fill the row with the chosen answer

        for j in range(5):
            if all(new_state[i][j] is None for i in range(5)):  # Check if the column is completely empty
                if vertical_answers[j]:  # Ensure there are possible answers for this column
                    answer = random.choice(vertical_answers[j])  # Choose a random answer
                    for i in range(5):
                        new_state[i][j] = answer[i]  # Fill the column with the chosen answer
        
        # Fill remaining None cells with empty strings
        for i in range(5):

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Adding an Empty String:** Instead of leaving `None` in the grid, the code replaces remaining `None` values with empty strings `''`. This avoids any situation where the grid could contain `None` that would later be used in string operations.

2. **Logic Cleanliness:** The checks to fill in rows and columns are untouched, ensuring that only empty rows and columns are filled. 

This should effectively prevent any `NoneType` errors during string operations in the `goal_test` function. Make sure any logic associated with the crossword considers the implications of having empty strings as valid entries.
